We study securities cases involving cryptocurrencies as one of numerous\ncontexts where AI could support the legal process, studying LLMs' legal\nreasoning and drafting capabilities. We examine whether a) an LLM can\naccurately determine which laws are potentially being violated from a fact\npattern, and b) whether there is a difference in juror decision-making based on\ncomplaints written by a lawyer compared to an LLM. We feed fact patterns from\nreal-life cases to GPT-3.5 and evaluate its ability to determine correct\npotential violations from the scenario and exclude spurious violations. Second,\nwe had mock jurors assess complaints written by the LLM and lawyers. GPT-3.5's\nlegal reasoning skills proved weak, though we expect improvement in future\nmodels, particularly given the violations it suggested tended to be correct (it\nmerely missed additional, correct violations). GPT-3.5 performed better at\nlegal drafting, and jurors' decisions were not statistically significantly\nassociated with the author of the document upon which they based their\ndecisions. Because LLMs cannot satisfactorily conduct legal reasoning tasks,\nthey would be unable to replace lawyers at this stage. However, their drafting\nskills (though, perhaps, still inferior to lawyers), could provide access to\njustice for more individuals by reducing the cost of legal services. Our\nresearch is the first to systematically study LLMs' legal drafting and\nreasoning capabilities in litigation, as well as in securities law and\ncryptocurrency-related misconduct.\n","authors":["Arianna Trozze","Toby Davies","Bennett Kleinberg"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06032v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16175v1","updated":"2023-08-30T17:53:25Z","published":"2023-08-30T17:53:25Z","title":"Quantifying Uncertainty in Answers from any Language Model via Intrinsic\n  and Extrinsic Confidence Assessment","summary":"  We introduce BSDetector, a method for detecting bad and speculative answers\nfrom a pretrained Large Language Model by estimating a numeric confidence score\nfor any output it generated.

As\nthese LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the\nneeds to conduct longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts.\nIn these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long\nsequences become more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training\nsequences to a fixed length (such as 2048 for LLaMa).

However, for some applications, broadly precise grammatical\ncorrectness is critical -- native speakers may find entity-related grammar\nerrors silly, jarring, or even offensive.\n  To enable the creation of more linguistically diverse NLG datasets, we\nrelease a Corpus of Linguistically Significant Entities (CLSE) annotated by\nlinguist experts. The corpus includes 34 languages and covers 74 different\nsemantic types to support various applications from airline ticketing to video\ngames.

In this study, we propose a novel W4A8\npost-training quantization method for the available open-sourced LLMs, which\ncombines the advantages of both two recipes. Therefore, we can leverage the\nbenefit in the I/O utilization of 4-bit weight quantization and the\nacceleration due to 8-bit matrix computation. Nevertheless, the W4A8 faces\nnotorious performance degradation. As a remedy, we involve layerwise activation\nquantization strategies which feature a novel logarithmic equalization for most\nintractable layers, and we combine them with fine-grained weight quantization.\nWithout whistles and bells, we eliminate the necessity for further fine-tuning\nand obtain the state-of-the-art W4A8 quantized performance on BLOOM, LLaMA, and\nLLaMA-2 on standard benchmarks.

Automated approaches to radiology reporting require\nthe image to be encoded into a suitable token representation for input to the\nlanguage model. Previous methods commonly use convolutional neural networks to\nencode an image into a series of image-level feature map representations.\nHowever, the generated reports often exhibit realistic style but imperfect\naccuracy. Inspired by recent works for image captioning in the general domain\nin which each visual token corresponds to an object detected in an image, we\ninvestigate whether using local tokens corresponding to anatomical structures\ncan improve the quality of the generated reports.

Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,\ndetecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable\nin high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked\nModality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables\nsegmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method\nis based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality\ntranslation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.\nImage-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are\ncharacteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to\ntranslate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during\ntraining, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine\nimage translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to\n`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown\npatterns as the generative model fails to recreate them.

However, the absence of labeled target data in UDA is overly\nrestrictive and limits performance.

However, due to the limited number of tracking sensors (three in\ntotal), faithfully recovering the user in full-body is challenging, limiting\nthe potential for interactions among simulated user avatars within the virtual\nworld. Therefore, recent studies have attempted to reconstruct full-body poses\nusing neural networks that utilize previously learned human poses or accept a\nseries of past poses over a short period. In this paper, we propose a method\nthat utilizes information from a neural motion prior to improve the accuracy of\nreconstructed user's motions. Our approach aims to reconstruct user's full-body\nposes by predicting the latent representation of the user's overall motion from\nlimited input signals and integrating this information with tracking sensor\ninputs. This is based on the premise that the ultimate goal of pose\nreconstruction is to reconstruct the motion, which is a series of poses. Our\nresults show that this integration enables more accurate reconstruction of the\nuser's full-body motion, particularly enhancing the robustness of lower body\nmotion reconstruction from impoverished signals.

Numerous pruning methods have been\nproposed since then, each claiming to be better than the previous. Many\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques today rely on complex pruning methodologies\nutilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or\nhaving heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. In this work, we question\nwhether this pattern of introducing complexity is really necessary to achieve\nbetter pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against a naive\npruning baseline, namely, Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP). Global MP ranks\nweights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Hence, in\nits vanilla form, it is one of the simplest pruning techniques. Surprisingly,\nwe find that vanilla Global MP outperforms all the other SOTA techniques and\nachieves a new SOTA result. It also achieves promising performance on FLOPs\nsparsification, which we find is enhanced, when pruning is conducted in a\ngradual fashion. We also find that Global MP is generalizable across tasks,\ndatasets, and models with superior performance. Moreover, a common issue that\nmany pruning algorithms run into at high sparsity rates, namely,\nlayer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP by setting a minimum threshold\nof weights to be retained in each layer.

Despite its significance, underwater\ntracking has remained unexplored due to data inaccessibility. It poses distinct\nchallenges; the underwater environment exhibits non-uniform lighting\nconditions, low visibility, lack of sharpness, low contrast, camouflage, and\nreflections from suspended particles. Performance of traditional tracking\nmethods designed primarily for terrestrial or open-air scenarios drops in such\nconditions. We address the problem by proposing a novel underwater image\nenhancement algorithm designed specifically to boost tracking quality. The\nmethod has resulted in a significant performance improvement, of up to 5.0%\nAUC, of state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual trackers. To develop robust and accurate\nUVOT methods, large-scale datasets are required. To this end, we introduce a\nlarge-scale UVOT benchmark dataset consisting of 400 video segments and 275,000\nmanually annotated frames enabling underwater training and evaluation of deep\ntrackers. The videos are labelled with several underwater-specific tracking\nattributes including watercolor variation, target distractors, camouflage,\ntarget relative size, and low visibility conditions.

In this paper, we propose an NVC model exploiting\nhierarchical B-frame coding with temporal layer-adaptive optimization.

To address this, we introduce\ntemporal layer-adaptive optimization, incorporating methods such as temporal\nlayer-adaptive quality scaling (TAQS) and temporal layer-adaptive latent\nscaling (TALS).

In this\npaper, we propose Pose Transfer by Permuting Textures (PT$^2$), an approach for\nself-driven human pose transfer that disentangles pose from texture at the\npatch-level.

There were two purposes for the\ncreation of this challenge: (1) the establishment of the first standardised\nbenchmark for the research community to assess soft-tissue trackers; and (2) to\nencourage the development of unsupervised deep learning methods, given the lack\nof annotated data in surgery. A dataset of 157 stereo endoscopic videos from 20\nclinical cases, along with stereo camera calibration parameters, have been\nprovided. Participants were assigned the task of developing algorithms to track\nthe movement of soft tissues, represented by bounding boxes, in stereo\nendoscopic videos. At the end of the challenge, the developed methods were\nassessed on a previously hidden test subset. This assessment uses benchmarking\nmetrics that were purposely developed for this challenge, to verify the\nefficacy of unsupervised deep learning algorithms in tracking soft-tissue. The\nmetric used for ranking the methods was the Expected Average Overlap (EAO)\nscore, which measures the average overlap between a tracker's and the ground\ntruth bounding boxes. Coming first in the challenge was the deep learning\nsubmission by ICVS-2Ai with a superior EAO score of 0.617.

In this work, we\ndevelop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexibly\nconstruct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and apply\nself-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity of\nthe whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method that\nstochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into a\nsingle object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructed\nobjects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame because\nproper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.\nFinally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level and\nexternal-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden Point\nRemoval (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used for\nadaptively controlling the point density of each object according to the\nobject's distance from the LiDAR.

This work eliminates this bottleneck by selecting\nrepresentations based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD) between raw\nevents and their representation. It is about 200 times faster to compute than\ntraining a neural network and preserves the task performance ranking of event\nrepresentations across multiple representations, network backbones, datasets,\nand tasks.

The optimal stage\n(early or late) to fuse modality features into item representations is still\ndebated. We propose a graph-based approach (named MMSR) to fuse modality\nfeatures in an adaptive order, enabling each modality to prioritize either its\ninherent sequential nature or its interplay with other modalities. MMSR\nrepresents each user's history as a graph, where the modality features of each\nitem in a user's history sequence are denoted by cross-linked nodes. The edges\nbetween homogeneous nodes represent intra-modality sequential relationships,\nand the ones between heterogeneous nodes represent inter-modality\ninterdependence relationships. During graph propagation, MMSR incorporates dual\nattention, differentiating homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. To\nadaptively assign nodes with distinct fusion orders, MMSR allows each node's\nrepresentation to be asynchronously updated through an update gate. In\nscenarios where modalities exhibit stronger sequential relationships, the\nupdate gate prioritizes updates among homogeneous nodes. Conversely, when the\ninterdependent relationships between modalities are more pronounced, the update\ngate prioritizes updates among heterogeneous nodes. Consequently, MMSR\nestablishes a fusion order that spans a spectrum from early to late modality\nfusion. In experiments across six datasets, MMSR consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models, and our graph propagation methods surpass other graph\nneural networks. Additionally, MMSR naturally manages missing modalities.\n","authors":["Hengchang Hu","Wei Guo","Yong Liu","Min-Yen Kan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15980v1.pdf","comment":"CIKM'2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15968v1","updated":"2023-08-30T11:45:35Z","published":"2023-08-30T11:45:35Z","title":"Denoising Attention for Query-aware User Modeling in Personalized Search","summary":"  The personalization of search results has gained increasing attention in the\npast few years, thanks to the development of Neural Networks-based approaches\nfor Information Retrieval and the importance of personalization in many search\nscenarios.

Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in\nmedical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the\ncontrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and\nimplicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from\nthe numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as\nthe IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as\nwell as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and\nPrinceton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is\ncreated as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate\nthe translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and\nit extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical\nmedical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet\nare modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it\ncomplements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design\n(CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes,\nand provides annotations in the form of paired data.

We developed a new hybrid training data generation\nmethod that enables the end-to-end training for solving background field\ncorrection and dipole inversion in a data-consistent fashion using a\nvariational network that combines the QSM model term and a learned regularizer.\nWe demonstrate that NeXtQSM overcomes the limitations of previous deep learning\nmethods.

The recent chat leak of\nthe Conti RaaS operator, one of the most infamous ransomware operators on the\ninternational scene, offers a key opportunity to better understand the inner\nworkings of such organizations. This paper analyzes the main topic discussions\nin the Conti chat leak using machine learning techniques such as Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as\nvisualization strategies. Five discussion topics are found: 1) Business, 2)\nTechnical, 3) Internal tasking/Management, 4) Malware, and 5) Customer\nService/Problem Solving. Moreover, the distribution of topics among Conti\nmembers shows that only 4% of individuals have specialized discussions while\nalmost all individuals (96%) are all-rounders, meaning that their discussions\nrevolve around the five topics. The results also indicate that a significant\nproportion of Conti discussions are non-tech related. This study thus\nhighlights that running such large RaaS operations requires a workforce skilled\nbeyond technical abilities, with individuals involved in various tasks, from\nmanagement to customer service or problem solving. The discussion topics also\nshow that the organization behind the Conti RaaS oper5086933ator shares\nsimilarities with a large firm.

The\nestimator achieves near minimax rate for general sub-Gaussian distributions,\nbut also suffers from two downsides: theoretically, there is an essential gap\non operator norm error between their estimator and sample covariance when the\ndiagonal of the covariance matrix is dominated by only a few entries;\npractically, its performance heavily relies on the dithering scale, which needs\nto be tuned according to some unknown parameters. In this work, we propose a\nnew 2-bit covariance matrix estimator that simultaneously addresses both\nissues. Unlike the sign quantizer associated with uniform dither in Dirksen et\nal., we adopt a triangular dither prior to a 2-bit quantizer inspired by the\nmulti-bit uniform quantizer. By employing dithering scales varying across\nentries, our estimator enjoys an improved operator norm error rate that depends\non the effective rank of the underlying covariance matrix rather than the\nambient dimension, thus closing the theoretical gap. Moreover, our proposed\nmethod eliminates the need of any tuning parameter, as the dithering scales are\nentirely determined by the data. Experimental results under Gaussian samples\nare provided to showcase the impressive numerical performance of our estimator.\nRemarkably, by halving the dithering scales, our estimator oftentimes achieves\noperator norm errors less than twice of the errors of sample covariance.\n","authors":["Junren Chen","Michael K.

A Case Study on\n  Global Magnitude Pruning","summary":"  Pruning neural networks has become popular in the last decade when it was\nshown that a large number of weights can be safely removed from modern neural\nnetworks without compromising accuracy. Numerous pruning methods have been\nproposed since then, each claiming to be better than the previous. Many\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques today rely on complex pruning methodologies\nutilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or\nhaving heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. In this work, we question\nwhether this pattern of introducing complexity is really necessary to achieve\nbetter pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against a naive\npruning baseline, namely, Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP). Global MP ranks\nweights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Hence, in\nits vanilla form, it is one of the simplest pruning techniques. Surprisingly,\nwe find that vanilla Global MP outperforms all the other SOTA techniques and\nachieves a new SOTA result. It also achieves promising performance on FLOPs\nsparsification, which we find is enhanced, when pruning is conducted in a\ngradual fashion. We also find that Global MP is generalizable across tasks,\ndatasets, and models with superior performance. Moreover, a common issue that\nmany pruning algorithms run into at high sparsity rates, namely,\nlayer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP by setting a minimum threshold\nof weights to be retained in each layer. Lastly, unlike many other SOTA\ntechniques, Global MP does not require any additional algorithm specific\nhyper-parameters and is very straightforward to tune and implement.

Therefore, it is natural to employ the concept of clustering homogeneous\nclients into the same group, allowing only the model weights within each group\nto be aggregated. While most existing clustered federated learning methods\nemploy either model gradients or inference outputs as metrics for client\npartitioning, with the goal of grouping similar devices together, may still\nhave heterogeneity within each cluster. Moreover, there is a scarcity of\nresearch exploring the underlying reasons for determining the appropriate\ntiming for clustering, resulting in the common practice of assigning each\nclient to its own individual cluster, particularly in the context of highly non\nindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data.

In this work,\nwe analyze the effect of this design choice for the alignment and evaluation of\nLLMs. We uncover an inconsistency problem wherein the preferences inferred from\nratings and rankings significantly disagree 60% for both human and AI\nannotators. Our subsequent analysis identifies various facets of annotator\nbiases that explain this phenomena, such as human annotators would rate denser\nresponses higher while preferring accuracy during pairwise judgments. To our\nsurprise, we also observe that the choice of feedback protocol also has a\nsignificant effect on the evaluation of aligned LLMs. In particular, we find\nthat LLMs that leverage rankings data for alignment (say model X) are preferred\nover those that leverage ratings data (say model Y), with a rank-based\nevaluation protocol (is X/Y's response better than reference response?) but not\nwith a rating-based evaluation protocol (score Rank X/Y's response on a scale\nof 1-7).

As a result, various privacy-preserving techniques have\nbeen implemented to preserve user data privacy in DL. Among various\nprivacy-preserving techniques, collaborative learning techniques, such as Split\nLearning (SL) have been utilized to accelerate the learning and prediction\nprocess. Initially, SL was considered a promising approach to data privacy.\nHowever, subsequent research has demonstrated that SL is susceptible to many\ntypes of attacks and, therefore, it cannot serve as a privacy-preserving\ntechnique. Meanwhile, countermeasures using a combination of SL and encryption\nhave also been introduced to achieve privacy-preserving deep learning. In this\nwork, we propose a hybrid approach using SL and Homomorphic Encryption (HE).\nThe idea behind it is that the client encrypts the activation map (the output\nof the split layer between the client and the server) before sending it to the\nserver. Hence, during both forward and backward propagation, the server cannot\nreconstruct the client's input data from the intermediate activation map. This\nimprovement is important as it reduces privacy leakage compared to other\nSL-based works, where the server can gain valuable information about the\nclient's input.

This temporal element produces a more complex\nproblem that can potentially leave current solutions under-constrained,\nunstable during training, or prone to varying degrees of mode collapse. In\nFETSGAN, entire sequences are translated directly to the generator's sampling\nspace using a seq2seq style adversarial auto encoder (AAE), where adversarial\ntraining is used to match the training distribution in both the feature space\nand the lower dimensional sampling space. This additional constraint provides a\nloose assurance that the temporal distribution of the synthetic samples will\nnot collapse.

Classical program analysis techniques such as dataflow analysis can\ndetect many types of bugs based on their root causes. In this paper, we propose\nto combine such causal-based vulnerability detection algorithms with deep\nlearning, aiming to achieve more efficient and effective vulnerability\ndetection. Specifically, we designed DeepDFA, a dataflow analysis-inspired\ngraph learning framework and an embedding technique that enables graph learning\nto simulate dataflow computation. We show that DeepDFA is both performant and\nefficient. DeepDFA outperformed all non-transformer baselines. It was trained\nin 9 minutes, 75x faster than the highest-performing baseline model. When using\nonly 50+ vulnerable and several hundreds of total examples as training data,\nthe model retained the same performance as 100% of the dataset.

The purpose of this document\nis to share the excitement of the authors with the community and highlight a\npromising research direction in robotics and AI. The authors believe the\nproposed paradigm is a feasible path towards accomplishing the long-standing\ngoal of robotics research: deploying robots, or embodied AI agents more\nbroadly, in various non-factory real-world settings to perform diverse tasks.\nThis document presents a specific idea for mining knowledge in the latest\nlarge-scale foundation models for robotics research. Instead of directly using\nor adapting these models to produce low-level policies and actions, it\nadvocates for a fully automated generative pipeline (termed as generative\nsimulation), which uses these models to generate diversified tasks, scenes and\ntraining supervisions at scale, thereby scaling up low-level skill learning and\nultimately leading to a foundation model for robotics that empowers generalist\nrobots. The authors are actively pursuing this direction, but in the meantime,\nthey recognize that the ambitious goal of building generalist robots with\nlarge-scale policy training demands significant resources such as computing\npower and hardware, and research groups in academia alone may face severe\nresource constraints in implementing the entire vision.

An adversary carrying out a backdoor attack embeds a\npredefined perturbation called a trigger into a small subset of input samples\nand trains the DNN such that the presence of the trigger in the input results\nin an adversary-desired output class. Such adversarial retraining however needs\nto ensure that outputs for inputs without the trigger remain unaffected and\nprovide high classification accuracy on clean samples. In this paper, we\npropose MDTD, a Multi-Domain Trojan Detector for DNNs, which detects inputs\ncontaining a Trojan trigger at testing time. MDTD does not require knowledge of\ntrigger-embedding strategy of the attacker and can be applied to a pre-trained\nDNN model with image, audio, or graph-based inputs. MDTD leverages an insight\nthat input samples containing a Trojan trigger are located relatively farther\naway from a decision boundary than clean samples. MDTD estimates the distance\nto a decision boundary using adversarial learning methods and uses this\ndistance to infer whether a test-time input sample is Trojaned or not. We\nevaluate MDTD against state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods across five\nwidely used image-based datasets: CIFAR100, CIFAR10, GTSRB, SVHN, and\nFlowers102; four graph-based datasets: AIDS, WinMal, Toxicant, and COLLAB; and\nthe SpeechCommand audio dataset.

To mitigate the computational challenges posed by\nsampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and\nfacilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process\nleverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently\nevaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our\nmodel is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating\nvarious types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of\nsimulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the\nmodel's prowess and advantages.

This paper describes the Gender-GAP Pipeline (for Gender-Aware\nPolyglot Pipeline), an automatic pipeline to characterize gender representation\nin large-scale datasets for 55 languages. The pipeline uses a multilingual\nlexicon of gendered person-nouns to quantify the gender representation in text.\nWe showcase it to report gender representation in WMT training data and\ndevelopment data for the News task, confirming that current data is skewed\ntowards masculine representation. Having unbalanced datasets may indirectly\noptimize our systems towards outperforming one gender over the others. We\nsuggest introducing our gender quantification pipeline in current datasets and,\nideally, modifying them toward a balanced representation.\n","authors":["Benjamin Muller","Belen Alastruey","Prangthip Hansanti","Elahe Kalbassi","Christophe Ropers","Eric Michael Smith","Adina Williams","Luke Zettlemoyer","Pierre Andrews","Marta R.

Such compositionality has been\nwidely studied previously in the form of hierarchical trees including untagged\nand sentiment ones, which are intrinsically suboptimal in our view. To address\nthis, we propose semantic tree, a new tree form capable of interpreting the\nsentiment composition in a principled way. Semantic tree is a derivation of a\ncontext-free grammar (CFG) describing the specific composition rules on\ndifference semantic roles, which is designed carefully following previous\nlinguistic conclusions.

Conventional formant tracking methods typically adopt a\ntwo-stage estimate-and-track strategy wherein an initial set of formant\ncandidates are estimated using short-time analysis (e.g., 10--50 ms), followed\nby a tracking stage based on dynamic programming or a linear state-space model.\nOne of the main disadvantages of these approaches is that the tracking stage,\nhowever good it may be, cannot improve upon the formant estimation accuracy of\nthe first stage. The proposed TVQCP method provides a single-stage formant\ntracking that combines the estimation and tracking stages into one. TVQCP\nanalysis combines three approaches to improve formant estimation and tracking:\n(1) it uses temporally weighted quasi-closed-phase analysis to derive\nclosed-phase estimates of the vocal tract with reduced interference from the\nexcitation source, (2) it increases the residual sparsity by using the $L_1$\noptimization and (3) it uses time-varying linear prediction analysis over long\ntime windows (e.g., 100--200 ms) to impose a continuity constraint on the vocal\ntract model and hence on the formant trajectories. Formant tracking experiments\nwith a wide variety of synthetic and natural speech signals show that the\nproposed TVQCP method performs better than conventional and popular formant\ntracking tools, such as Wavesurfer and Praat (based on dynamic programming),\nthe KARMA algorithm (based on Kalman filtering), and DeepFormants (based on\ndeep neural networks trained in a supervised manner).

The distributions are often over multiple ambiguous words at a\ntime; a multiplicity which makes them a suitable topic for sheaf-theoretic\nmodels of quantum contextuality. Previous research showed that different\nquantitative measures of contextuality correlate well with Psycholinguistic\nresearch on lexical ambiguities. In this work, we focus on coreference\nambiguities and investigate the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a test\nproposed by Levesque in 2011 to evaluate the intelligence of machines. The WSC\nconsists of a collection of multiple-choice questions that require\ndisambiguating pronouns in sentences structured according to the Winograd\nschema, in a way that makes it difficult for machines to determine the correct\nreferents but remains intuitive for human comprehension. In this study, we\npropose an approach that analogously models the Winograd schema as an\nexperiment in quantum physics. However, we argue that the original Winograd\nSchema is inherently too simplistic to facilitate contextuality. We introduce a\nnovel mechanism for generalising the schema, rendering it analogous to a\nBell-CHSH measurement scenario.

In this\npaper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to\ncomprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we construct\na comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world\nimages and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27\nsubtasks. This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and\ncomprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integrating\ndetailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input\ncontent into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advanced\nLLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without\nrequiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful\nLVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging\ntheir textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences.

These methods, however, can degrade the quality of\nphotos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age,\ngender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, GANs, such as StyleGAN, have\nbeen proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In this\npaper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified faces\nthrough style mixing. We examined this de-identification method for preserving\nutility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, and\nidentification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from our\nextensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with two\nstate-of-the-art methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGAN\nperforms on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy and\nimages' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-based\nexperiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN and\nDeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN0-3 preserves\nutility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine both\nprivacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as well\nas CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Our\nstatistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identify\nStyleGAN0-5 images more easily than DeepPrivacy images.

Hence, predicting\ninflammatory disease activity is crucial for disease assessment and treatment.\nHowever, MS lesions can occur throughout the brain and vary in shape, size and\ntotal count among patients. The high variance in lesion load and locations\nmakes it challenging for machine learning methods to learn a globally effective\nrepresentation of whole-brain MRI scans to assess and predict disease.\nTechnically it is non-trivial to incorporate essential biomarkers such as\nlesion load or spatial proximity. Our work represents the first attempt to\nutilize graph neural networks (GNN) to aggregate these biomarkers for a novel\nglobal representation. We propose a two-stage MS inflammatory disease activity\nprediction approach. First, a 3D segmentation network detects lesions, and a\nself-supervised algorithm extracts their image features. Second, the detected\nlesions are used to build a patient graph. The lesions act as nodes in the\ngraph and are initialized with image features extracted in the first stage.\nFinally, the lesions are connected based on their spatial proximity and the\ninflammatory disease activity prediction is formulated as a graph\nclassification task. Furthermore, we propose a self-pruning strategy to\nauto-select the most critical lesions for prediction. Our proposed method\noutperforms the existing baseline by a large margin (AUCs of 0.67 vs. 0.61 and\n0.66 vs. 0.60 for one-year and two-year inflammatory disease activity,\nrespectively).

Despite their success in gait recognition for in-the-lab environments,\nthey usually fail in real-world scenarios due to their low information entropy\nfor gait representations. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild,\nthis paper presents a novel gait representation, named Gait Parsing Sequence\n(GPS). GPSs are sequences of fine-grained human segmentation, i.e., human\nparsing, extracted from video frames, so they have much higher information\nentropy to encode the shapes and dynamics of fine-grained human parts during\nwalking. Moreover, to effectively explore the capability of the GPS\nrepresentation, we propose a novel human parsing-based gait recognition\nframework, named ParsingGait. ParsingGait contains a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN)-based backbone and two light-weighted heads. The first head\nextracts global semantic features from GPSs, while the other one learns mutual\ninformation of part-level features through Graph Convolutional Networks to\nmodel the detailed dynamics of human walking.

This method combines consistency\nregularization, pseudo-labels, and data augmentation to enhance the efficacy of\nsemi-supervised segmentation. Firstly, the proposed model comprises both\nstudent and teacher models with a shared encoder and two distinct decoders\nemploying different up-sampling strategies. Minimizing the output discrepancy\nbetween decoders enforces the generation of consistent representations, serving\nas regularization during student model training. Secondly, we introduce mixup\noperations to blend unlabeled data with labeled data, creating mixed data and\nthereby achieving data augmentation.

In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that\nupdates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the\nself-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually\nincreasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and\ntransferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel\nlearnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of\ndifferent complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked\nautoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting\nits behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE\n(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the\nopposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between\nthese behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with\nthe reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure\ngenerates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked\nAutoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior\nrepresentation learning capabilities compared to MAE.

However, the sparsity and disorderliness of point clouds make it\nchallenging to extract features directly from them. Many studies have addressed\nthis issue by transforming point clouds into regular voxel representations.\nHowever, these methods often lead to the loss of fine-grained local feature\ninformation due to downsampling. Moreover, the sparsity of point clouds poses\ndifficulties in efficiently aggregating features in 3D feature layers using\nvoxel-based two-stage methods. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\ntwo-stage 3D detection framework called MS$^{2}$3D. In MS$^{2}$3D, we utilize\nsmall-sized voxels to extract fine-grained local features and large-sized\nvoxels to capture long-range local features.

To address the low\nillumination challenge in nighttime person Re-ID, this paper proposes an\nIllumination Distillation Framework (IDF), which utilizes illumination\nenhancement and illumination distillation schemes to promote the learning of\nRe-ID models. Specifically, IDF consists of a master branch, an illumination\nenhancement branch, and an illumination distillation module. The master branch\nis used to extract the features from a nighttime image. The illumination\nenhancement branch first estimates an enhanced image from the nighttime image\nusing a nonlinear curve mapping method and then extracts the enhanced features.\nHowever, nighttime and enhanced features usually contain data noise due to\nunstable lighting conditions and enhancement failures. To fully exploit the\ncomplementary benefits of nighttime and enhanced features while suppressing\ndata noise, we propose an illumination distillation module.

Our innovation lies in the design of three\nkey modules: 1) An online fast gradient descent optimizer, further optimized by\na meta-learner, which ensures swift and robust adaptation to new tasks. 2) A\nSelf-Sampling module designed to provide well-aligned visual prompts for\nimproved attention allocation; and 3) A robust attention-based decoder\nspecifically designed for medical few-shot learning to capture relationship\nbetween different slices. Extensive experiments on a popular abdominal CT\ndataset and an MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in few-shot\nsegmentation, with an average improvements of 10.21% and 1.80% in terms of DSC,\nrespectively. In conclusion, we present a novel approach for rapid online\nadaptation in interactive image segmentation, adapting to a new organ in just\n0.83 minutes.

In this paper, we propose a federated adaptive\nprompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for multi-domain collaborative image\nclassification with powerful foundation models, like CLIP. Compared with direct\nfederated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively unlock specific domain\nknowledge for each test sample in order to provide them with personalized\nprompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt tuning module,\nwhich consists of a meta prompt, an adaptive network, and some keys. The server\nrandomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to each client. Then\nall clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network and meta prompt\nwith the local datasets and the frozen keys.

Although a bunch of empirical\nstudies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of\nthese findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice.

Our investigations focus on their joint effects,\nrather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series\nof theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution\nshift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity.\nBuilding on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and\ngradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off\ngenerally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a\ncomprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability.\nFinally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost\ntransferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity\nsimultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and\nsharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments.

Most works in this field focus on designing network\nstructures or pre-training tasks. All these methods list the OCR texts in\nreading order (from left to right and top to bottom) to form a sequence, which\nis treated as a natural language ``sentence''. However, they ignore the fact\nthat most OCR words in the TextVQA task do not have a semantical contextual\nrelationship. In addition, these approaches use 1-D position embedding to\nconstruct the spatial relation between OCR tokens sequentially, which is not\nreasonable. The 1-D position embedding can only represent the left-right\nsequence relationship between words in a sentence, but not the complex spatial\nposition relationship. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method\nnamed Separate and Locate (SaL) that explores text contextual cues and designs\nspatial position embedding to construct spatial relations between OCR texts.\nSpecifically, we propose a Text Semantic Separate (TSS) module that helps the\nmodel recognize whether words have semantic contextual relations.

To address this, we introduce\ntemporal layer-adaptive optimization, incorporating methods such as temporal\nlayer-adaptive quality scaling (TAQS) and temporal layer-adaptive latent\nscaling (TALS).

However, most existing methods for VLU focus on sparsely sampling or\nfine-graining the input information (e.g., sampling a sparse set of frames or\ntext tokens), or adding external knowledge. We present a novel \"DRAX:\nDistraction Removal and Attended Cross-Alignment\" method to rid our cross-modal\nrepresentations of distractors in the latent space. We do not exclusively\nconfine the perception of any input information from various modalities but\ninstead use an attention-guided distraction removal method to increase focus on\ntask-relevant information in latent embeddings. DRAX also ensures semantic\nalignment of embeddings during cross-modal fusions.

However, compared to the Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) models, it has been observed that the ViT models struggle to\ncapture high-frequency components of images, which can limit their ability to\ndetect local textures and edge information. As abnormalities in human tissue,\nsuch as tumors and lesions, may greatly vary in structure, texture, and shape,\nhigh-frequency information such as texture is crucial for effective semantic\nsegmentation tasks. To address this limitation in ViT models, we propose a new\ntechnique, Laplacian-Former, that enhances the self-attention map by adaptively\nre-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. More\nspecifically, our proposed method utilizes a dual attention mechanism via\nefficient attention and frequency attention while the efficient attention\nmechanism reduces the complexity of self-attention to linear while producing\nthe same output, selectively intensifying the contribution of shape and texture\nfeatures.

Recent works explore\nvision-language pre-training to handle this task, but suffer from unrealistic\nassumptions in practical scenarios, i.e., low-quality textual category names.\nFor example, this paradigm assumes that new textual categories will be\naccurately and completely provided, and exist in lexicons during pre-training.\nHowever, exceptions often happen when meet with ambiguity for brief or\nincomplete names, new words that are not present in the pre-trained lexicons,\nand difficult-to-describe categories for users. To address these issues, this\nwork proposes a novel decomposition-aggregation framework, inspired by human\ncognition in understanding new concepts.

Two attribute construction strategies are designed: using\nlarge language models for common categories, and involving manually labelling\nfor human-invented categories. In the aggregation stage, we group diverse\nattributes into an integrated global description, to form a discriminative\nclassifier that distinguishes the target object from others. One hierarchical\naggregation is further designed to achieve multi-level alignment and deep\nfusion between vision and text.

We adopt a simple, yet surprisingly effective, approach called\ncontext aware query rewriting (CAR) to leverage the benefits of LLMs for query\nunderstanding. Firstly, we rewrite ambiguous training queries by context-aware\nprompting of LLMs, where we use only relevant documents as context.Unlike\nexisting approaches, we use LLM-based query rewriting only during the training\nphase. Eventually, a ranker is fine-tuned on the rewritten queries instead of\nthe original queries during training. In our extensive experiments, we find\nthat fine-tuning a ranker using re-written queries offers a significant\nimprovement of up to 33% on the passage ranking task and up to 28% on the\ndocument ranking task when compared to the baseline performance of using\noriginal queries.\n","authors":["Abhijit Anand","Venktesh V","Vinay Setty","Avishek Anand"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16753v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14276v2","updated":"2023-08-31T14:05:51Z","published":"2023-08-28T03:15:37Z","title":"Alleviating Video-Length Effect for Micro-video Recommendation","summary":"  Micro-videos platforms such as TikTok are extremely popular nowadays.

The similarity range\nis bounded by the code length and can lead to a problem known as similarity\ncollapse.

Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a\nsingle scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario\nprediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between\ndifferent scenarios.

This\nformalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers\noptimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with\nvanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to\nan SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter\n$W=KQ^\\top$.

The downstream effects of ADMs critically\ndepend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as\nbiases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many\nof these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they\nwill influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the\ndecisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these\ndecisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.\n  To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and\nintroduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness.

However,\nsince their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not\nable to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this\nrestriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN's locality\nof receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features,\ntheir segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the\nmodel sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size\nimproves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation\ntasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure.

Typically, this approach involves randomly masking\npatches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchanged\nduring training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that\nupdates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the\nself-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually\nincreasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and\ntransferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel\nlearnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of\ndifferent complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked\nautoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting\nits behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE\n(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the\nopposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between\nthese behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with\nthe reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure\ngenerates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked\nAutoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior\nrepresentation learning capabilities compared to MAE.

In computer vision, on the\ncontrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and\nimplicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from\nthe numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as\nthe IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as\nwell as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and\nPrinceton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is\ncreated as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate\nthe translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and\nit extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical\nmedical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet\nare modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it\ncomplements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design\n(CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes,\nand provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a\nfreely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality\n- VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing. This\nwhite paper describes in detail the motivations behind MedShapeNet, the shape\nacquisition procedures, the use cases, as well as the usage of the online shape\nsearch portal: https://medshapenet.ikim.nrw/\n","authors":["Jianning Li","Antonio Pepe","Christina Gsaxner","Gijs Luijten","Yuan Jin","Narmada Ambigapathy","Enrico Nasca","Naida Solak","Gian Marco Melito","Afaque R.

Meanwhile, PASS designs a semi-supervised\noptimization strategy based on pseudo-label iteration and dynamic loss\nweighting algorithms in order to effectively utilize massive unlabeled traffic\ndata and alleviate manual train dataset annotation workload. PASS outperforms\nstate-of-the-art ETC methods and generic sampling approaches on four public\ndatasets with significant class imbalance and traffic homogeneity, remarkably\npushing the F1 of Cross-Platform215 with 1.31%, ISCX-17 with 9.12%.\nFurthermore, we validate the generality of the contrastive pre-training and\npseudo-label iteration components of PASS, which can adaptively benefit ETC\nmethods with diverse feature extractors.\n","authors":["Xiang Li","Juncheng Guo","Qige Song","Jiang Xie","Yafei Sang","Shuyuan Zhao","Yongzheng Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16453v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by 2023 IEEE SECON, 9 pages, 6 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11029v2","updated":"2023-08-31T04:36:30Z","published":"2023-08-18T11:29:12Z","title":"RBA-GCN: Relational Bilevel Aggregation Graph Convolutional Network for\n  Emotion Recognition","summary":"  Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has received increasing attention\nfrom researchers due to its wide range of applications.As conversation has a\nnatural graph structure,numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results.However,the\naggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information\nredundancy problem,leading to node discriminant information\nloss.Additionally,single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range\ncontextual information from the graph.

To\naddress these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph\nconvolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph\ngeneration module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and\nbilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to\nreduce the redundancy of target node information.Then,SCBM calculates the node\nsimilarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy\ninformation with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant\ninformation of the node.

Firstly,\nusers generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and\nmodeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding\nof users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a\nsingle scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario\nprediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between\ndifferent scenarios.

Although a bunch of empirical\nstudies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of\nthese findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice. In this\npaper, we take a further step towards understanding adversarial\ntransferability, with a particular focus on surrogate aspects. Starting from\nthe intriguing little robustness phenomenon, where models adversarially trained\nwith mildly perturbed adversarial samples can serve as better surrogates, we\nattribute it to a trade-off between two predominant factors: model smoothness\nand gradient similarity. Our investigations focus on their joint effects,\nrather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series\nof theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution\nshift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity.\nBuilding on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and\ngradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off\ngenerally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a\ncomprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability.\nFinally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost\ntransferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity\nsimultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and\nsharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments. In\nsummary, we call for attention to the united impacts of these two factors for\nlaunching effective transfer attacks, rather than optimizing one while ignoring\nthe other, and emphasize the crucial role of manipulating surrogate models.\n","authors":["Yechao Zhang","Shengshan Hu","Leo Yu Zhang","Junyu Shi","Minghui Li","Xiaogeng Liu","Wei Wan","Hai Jin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07873v5.pdf","comment":"IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (Oakland) 2024; Extended\n  version of camera-ready"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16425v1","updated":"2023-08-31T03:28:43Z","published":"2023-08-31T03:28:43Z","title":"On the Equivalence between Implicit and Explicit Neural Networks: A\n  High-dimensional Viewpoint","summary":"  Implicit neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in various\ntasks.

Existing GNN models are commonly categorized\ninto two types: spectral GNNs, which are designed based on polynomial graph\nfilters, and spatial GNNs, which utilize a message-passing scheme as the\nfoundation of the model. For the expressive power and universality of spectral\nGNNs, a natural approach is to improve the design of basis functions for better\napproximation ability. As for spatial GNNs, models like Graph Isomorphism\nNetworks (GIN) analyze their expressive power based on Graph Isomorphism Tests.\nRecently, there have been attempts to establish connections between spatial\nGNNs and geometric concepts like curvature and cellular sheaves, as well as\nphysical phenomena like oscillators. However, despite the recent progress,\nthere is still a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the universality of\nspatial GNNs from the perspectives of geometry and physics. In this paper, we\npropose MetricGNN (MGNN), a spatial GNN model inspired by the\ncongruent-insensitivity property of classifiers in the classification phase of\nGNNs. We demonstrate that a GNN model is universal in the spatial domain if it\ncan generate embedding matrices that are congruent to any given embedding\nmatrix. This property is closely related to the Distance Geometry Problem\n(DGP). Since DGP is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem, we propose\noptimizing an energy function derived from spring networks and the\nMulti-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) problem.

In\npractice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to\nmissing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more\nchallenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion\nmethod, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for\ngraphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal\nwith the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of\nunfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness\ndue to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous\ngraphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most\ndownstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge,\nFairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution\ncompletion and graph unfairness problems.

While the prefill phase effectively saturates\nGPU compute at small batch sizes, the decode phase results in low compute\nutilization as it generates one token at a time per request. The varying\nprefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using\npipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.\n  We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs\nchunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and\ndecode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk\nand populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill\nchunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up\nto an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills\nallows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill\nrequest, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback.

However, for NLP tasks\nwhere each data point for inference is not necessarily lengthy, the token count\nfor instructions and few-shot examples in the prompt may be considerably larger\nthan that of the data point, resulting in lower token-resource utilization\ncompared with encoder-based models like fine-tuned BERT.

In\nthis chapter, we introduce the main mechanisms behind automatic sentence\nprocessing systems step by step and then focus on evaluating discourse\nconnective processing. We assess nine popular systems in their ability to\nunderstand English discourse connectives and analyze how context and language\nunderstanding tasks affect their connective comprehension. The results show\nthat NLP systems do not process all discourse connectives equally well and that\nthe computational processing complexity of different connective kinds is not\nalways consistently in line with the presumed complexity order found in human\nprocessing. In addition, while humans are more inclined to be influenced during\nthe reading procedure but not necessarily in the final comprehension\nperformance, discourse connectives have a significant impact on the final\naccuracy of NLP systems.

While\nthe technical level is concerned with accurate reconstruction of transmitted\nsymbols, the semantic and effectiveness levels deal with the inferred meaning\nand its effect on the receiver. Thanks to telecommunications, the first level\nproblem has produced great advances like the internet. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) make some progress towards the second goal, but the third level still\nremains largely untouched. The third problem deals with predicting and\noptimizing communication for desired receiver behavior. LLMs, while showing\nwide generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks, are unable to\nsolve for this. One reason for the underperformance could be a lack of\n\"behavior tokens\" in LLMs' training corpora. Behavior tokens define receiver\nbehavior over a communication, such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases,\nretweets, etc. While preprocessing data for LLM training, behavior tokens are\noften removed from the corpora as noise. Therefore, in this paper, we make some\ninitial progress towards reintroducing behavior tokens in LLM training. The\ntrained models, other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content\nunderstanding tasks, show generalization capabilities on behavior simulation,\ncontent simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation.\nUsing a wide range of tasks on two corpora, we show results on all these\ncapabilities. We call these models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs).\nFurther, to spur more research on LCBMs, we release our new Content Behavior\nCorpus (CBC), a repository containing communicator, message, and corresponding\nreceiver behavior.\n","authors":["Ashmit Khandelwal","Aditya Agrawal","Aanisha Bhattacharyya","Yaman K Singla","Somesh Singh","Uttaran Bhattacharya","Ishita Dasgupta","Stefano Petrangeli","Rajiv Ratn Shah","Changyou Chen","Balaji Krishnamurthy"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00359v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07863v3","updated":"2023-09-01T07:58:52Z","published":"2023-02-15T18:55:29Z","title":"Speculative Decoding with Big Little Decoder","summary":"  The recent emergence of Large Language Models based on the Transformer\narchitecture has enabled dramatic advancements in the field of Natural Language\nProcessing. However, these models have long inference latency, which limits\ntheir deployment, and which makes them prohibitively expensive for various\nreal-time applications. The inference latency is further exacerbated by\nautoregressive generative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate\ntokens sequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address\nthis, we propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve\ninference efficiency and latency for a wide range of text generation\napplications. The BiLD framework contains two models with different sizes that\ncollaboratively generate text. The small model runs autoregressively to\ngenerate text with a low inference cost, and the large model is only invoked\noccasionally to refine the small model's inaccurate predictions in a\nnon-autoregressive manner. To coordinate the small and large models, BiLD\nintroduces two simple yet effective policies: (1) the fallback policy that\ndetermines when to hand control over to the large model; and (2) the rollback\npolicy that determines when the large model needs to correct the small model's\ninaccurate predictions. To evaluate our framework across different tasks and\nmodels, we apply BiLD to various text generation scenarios encompassing machine\ntranslation on IWSLT 2017 De-En and WMT 2014 De-En, and summarization on XSUM\nand CNN/DailyMail. On an NVIDIA T4 GPU, our framework achieves a speedup of up\nto 2.12x speedup with minimal generation quality degradation.

This is due to the greater challenges posed by 3D city generation,\nmainly because humans are more sensitive to structural distortions in urban\nenvironments. Additionally, generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D\nnatural scenes since buildings, as objects of the same class, exhibit a wider\nrange of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of\nobjects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges, we propose\nCityDreamer, a compositional generative model designed specifically for\nunbounded 3D cities, which separates the generation of building instances from\nother background objects, such as roads, green lands, and water areas, into\ndistinct modules.

Most existing transformer-based methods leverage both\nvisual and depth representations to explore valuable query points on objects,\nand the quality of the learned query points has a great impact on detection\naccuracy. Unfortunately, existing unsupervised attention mechanisms in\ntransformers are prone to generate low-quality query features due to inaccurate\nreceptive fields, especially on hard objects. To tackle this problem, this\npaper proposes a novel \"Supervised Scale-aware Deformable Attention\" (SSDA) for\nmonocular 3D object detection. Specifically, SSDA presets several masks with\ndifferent scales and utilizes depth and visual features to adaptively learn a\nscale-aware filter for object query augmentation. Imposing the scale awareness,\nSSDA could well predict the accurate receptive field of an object query to\nsupport robust query feature generation. Aside from this, SSDA is assigned with\na Weighted Scale Matching (WSM) loss to supervise scale prediction, which\npresents more confident results as compared to the unsupervised attention\nmechanisms.

To\nincorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a\nvision-language foundation model ($\\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill\nrich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel. We evaluate GNFactor on 3\nreal robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10 RLBench tasks with a\nlimited number of demonstrations. We observe a substantial improvement of\nGNFactor over current state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen tasks,\ndemonstrating the strong generalization ability of GNFactor.

While\nthe technical level is concerned with accurate reconstruction of transmitted\nsymbols, the semantic and effectiveness levels deal with the inferred meaning\nand its effect on the receiver. Thanks to telecommunications, the first level\nproblem has produced great advances like the internet. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) make some progress towards the second goal, but the third level still\nremains largely untouched. The third problem deals with predicting and\noptimizing communication for desired receiver behavior. LLMs, while showing\nwide generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks, are unable to\nsolve for this. One reason for the underperformance could be a lack of\n\"behavior tokens\" in LLMs' training corpora. Behavior tokens define receiver\nbehavior over a communication, such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases,\nretweets, etc. While preprocessing data for LLM training, behavior tokens are\noften removed from the corpora as noise. Therefore, in this paper, we make some\ninitial progress towards reintroducing behavior tokens in LLM training. The\ntrained models, other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content\nunderstanding tasks, show generalization capabilities on behavior simulation,\ncontent simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation.\nUsing a wide range of tasks on two corpora, we show results on all these\ncapabilities.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce MuraNet, an attention-based multi-task model for segmentation and\ndetection tasks in floor plan data.

To this end, we propose a method that fuses monocular images\nand sparse IMUs for real-time human motion capture. Our method contains a dual\ncoordinate strategy to fully explore the IMU signals with different goals in\nmotion capture. To be specific, besides one branch transforming the IMU signals\nto the camera coordinate system to combine with the image information, there is\nanother branch to learn from the IMU signals in the body root coordinate system\nto better estimate body poses.

However,\nfor dense prediction, students' predictions on edge regions are highly\nuncertain due to contextual information leakage, requiring higher spatial\nsensitivity knowledge than the body regions. To address this challenge, this\npaper proposes a novel approach called boundary-privileged knowledge\ndistillation (BPKD). BPKD distills the knowledge of the teacher model's body\nand edges separately to the compact student model. Specifically, we employ two\ndistinct loss functions: (i) edge loss, which aims to distinguish between\nambiguous classes at the pixel level in edge regions; (ii) body loss, which\nutilizes shape constraints and selectively attends to the inner-semantic\nregions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed BPKD method provides\nextensive refinements and aggregation for edge and body regions. Additionally,\nthe method achieves state-of-the-art distillation performance for semantic\nsegmentation on three popular benchmark datasets, highlighting its\neffectiveness and generalization ability. BPKD shows consistent improvements\nacross a diverse array of lightweight segmentation structures, including both\nCNNs and transformers, underscoring its architecture-agnostic adaptability.

This\nis challenging since traditional detectors can only learn from pre-defined\ncategories and thus fail to detect and localize objects out of pre-defined\nvocabulary. To handle the challenge, OVD leverages pre-trained cross-modal VLM,\nsuch as CLIP, ALIGN, etc. Previous works mainly focus on the open vocabulary\nclassification part, with less attention on the localization part. We argue\nthat for a good OVD detector, both classification and localization should be\nparallelly studied for the novel object categories. We show in this work that\nimproving localization as well as cross-modal classification complement each\nother, and compose a good OVD detector jointly. We analyze three families of\nOVD methods with different design emphases. We first propose a vanilla\nmethod,i.e., cropping a bounding box obtained by a localizer and resizing it\ninto the CLIP. We next introduce another approach, which combines a standard\ntwo-stage object detector with CLIP. A two-stage object detector includes a\nvisual backbone, a region proposal network (RPN), and a region of interest\n(RoI) head. We decouple RPN and ROI head (DRR) and use RoIAlign to extract\nmeaningful features. In this case, it avoids resizing objects. To further\naccelerate the training time and reduce the model parameters, we couple RPN and\nROI head (CRR) as the third approach. We conduct extensive experiments on these\nthree types of approaches in different settings. On the OVD-COCO benchmark, DRR\nobtains the best performance and achieves 35.8 Novel AP$_{50}$, an absolute 2.8\ngain over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA). For OVD-LVIS, DRR surpasses the\nprevious SOTA by 1.9 AP$_{50}$ in rare categories.

Existing FSS methods merely rely on 2D representations of\nfacial semantic or appearance. However, professional human artists usually use\noutlines or shadings to covey 3D geometry. Thus facial 3D geometry (e.g. depth\nmap) is extremely important for FSS. Besides, different artists may use diverse\ndrawing techniques and create multiple styles of sketches; but the style is\nglobally consistent in a sketch. Inspired by such observations, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel Human-Inspired Dynamic Adaptation (HIDA) method.

We\npresent extensive empirical evidence for our ansatz, including identifying high\ncorrelation between covariances of filters and patch-based AGOPs for\nconvolutional layers in standard neural architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG,\nand ResNets pre-trained on ImageNet. We also provide supporting theoretical\nevidence. We then demonstrate the generality of our result by using the\npatch-based AGOP to enable deep feature learning in convolutional kernel\nmachines. We refer to the resulting algorithm as (Deep) ConvRFM and show that\nour algorithm recovers similar features to deep convolutional networks\nincluding the notable emergence of edge detectors. Moreover, we find that Deep\nConvRFM overcomes previously identified limitations of convolutional kernels,\nsuch as their inability to adapt to local signals in images and, as a result,\nleads to sizable performance improvement over fixed convolutional kernels.\n","authors":["Daniel Beaglehole","Adityanarayanan Radhakrishnan","Parthe Pandit","Mikhail Belkin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00570v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00569v1","updated":"2023-09-01T16:26:42Z","published":"2023-09-01T16:26:42Z","title":"Amyloid-Beta Axial Plane PET Synthesis from Structural MRI: An Image\n  Translation Approach for Screening Alzheimer's Disease","summary":"  In this work, an image translation model is implemented to produce synthetic\namyloid-beta PET images from structural MRI that are quantitatively accurate.\nImage pairs of amyloid-beta PET and structural MRI were used to train the\nmodel.

MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action\nspace of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,\nefficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often\nsegregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary\nmanipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space\nto MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. base actions for locomotion objectives and arm\nactions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous combinations of\nlocomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires human domain\nknowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the action parts\nto the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a new framework\nto train policies for typical MoMa tasks that makes use of the most favorable\nsubspace of the robot's action space to address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa\nautomatically discovers the causal dependencies between actions and terms of\nthe reward function and exploits these dependencies in a causal policy learning\nprocedure that reduces gradient variance compared to previous state-of-the-art\npolicy gradient algorithms, improving convergence and results.

To deal\nwith anomaly markers (e.g. occluded or with big tracking errors), the key\ninsight is that a marker's motion shows strong correlations with the motions of\nits immediate neighboring markers but less so with other markers, a.k.a.\nlocality, which enables us to efficiently fill missing markers (e.g. due to\nocclusion).

However, such SS models are inherently approximated and mismatched,\noften degrading the revenue. In this work, we propose KalmenNet-aided Bollinger\nbands Pairs Trading (KBPT), a deep learning aided policy that augments the\noperation of KF-aided BB trading. KBPT is designed by formulating an extended\nSS model for pairs trading that approximates their relationship as holding\npartial co-integration. This SS model is utilized by a trading policy that\naugments KF-BB trading with a dedicated neural network based on the KalmanNet\narchitecture. The resulting KBPT is trained in a two-stage manner which first\ntunes the tracking algorithm in an unsupervised manner independently of the\ntrading task, followed by its adaptation to track the financial indicators to\nmaximize revenue while approximating BB with a differentiable mapping. KBPT\nthus leverages data to overcome the approximated nature of the SS model,\nconverting the KF-BB policy into a trainable model. We empirically demonstrate\nthat our proposed KBPT systematically yields improved revenue compared with\nmodel-based and data-driven benchmarks over various different assets.\n","authors":["Amit Milstein","Haoran Deng","Guy Revach","Hai Morgenstern","Nir Shlezinger"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15448v2.pdf","comment":"Submitted to Transactions on Signal Processing"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00349v1","updated":"2023-09-01T09:15:04Z","published":"2023-09-01T09:15:04Z","title":"Bespoke Nanoparticle Synthesis and Chemical Knowledge Discovery Via\n  Autonomous Experimentations","summary":"  The optimization of nanomaterial synthesis using numerous synthetic variables\nis considered to be extremely laborious task because the conventional\ncombinatorial explorations are prohibitively expensive.

However,\nlow-fidelity models, while often displaying important qualitative\nspatio-temporal features, fail to accurately capture the onset of instability\nand critical transients observed in the high-fidelity models, making them\nimpractical as surrogate models. To address this shortcoming, we present a new\ndata-driven strategy that combines dimensionality reduction with multi-fidelity\nneural network surrogates.

Thus facial 3D geometry (e.g. depth\nmap) is extremely important for FSS. Besides, different artists may use diverse\ndrawing techniques and create multiple styles of sketches; but the style is\nglobally consistent in a sketch.

The reasoning capability is essential for large language models\n(LLMs) to serve as the brain of the artificial general intelligence agent.\nRecent studies reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on data with the chain of thought\n(COT) reasoning process can significantly enhance their reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs suffer from an \\textit{Assessment\nMisalignment} problem, i.e., they frequently assign higher scores to subpar\nCOTs, leading to potential limitations in their reasoning abilities. To address\nthis problem, we introduce an \\textit{Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT)} paradigm,\nwhich involves three steps: 1) fine-tuning LLMs with COT training data; 2)\ngenerating multiple COT responses for each question, and categorizing them into\npositive and negative ones based on whether they achieve the correct answer; 3)\ncalibrating the scores of positive and negative responses given by LLMs with a\nnovel constraint alignment loss. Specifically, the constraint alignment loss\nhas two objectives: a) Alignment, which guarantees that positive scores surpass\nnegative scores to encourage answers with high-quality COTs; b) Constraint,\nwhich keeps the negative scores confined to a reasonable range to prevent the\nmodel degradation. Beyond just the binary positive and negative feedback, the\nconstraint alignment loss can be seamlessly adapted to the ranking situations\nwhen ranking feedback is accessible. Furthermore, we also delve deeply into\nrecent ranking-based alignment methods, such as DPO, RRHF, and PRO, and\ndiscover that the constraint, which has been overlooked by these approaches, is\nalso crucial for their performance.

A straightforward strategy improving efficiency is to\nbatch data within the token limit (e.g., 8k for gpt-3.5-turbo; 32k for GPT-4),\nwhich we call BatchPrompt. We have two initial observations for prompting with\nbatched data. First, we find that prompting with batched data in longer\ncontexts will inevitably lead to worse performance, compared to single-data\nprompting. Second, the performance of the language model is significantly\ncorrelated with the positions and order of the batched data, due to the\ncorresponding change in decoder context. To retain efficiency and overcome\nperformance loss, we propose Batch Permutation and Ensembling (BPE), and a\nnovel Self-reflection-guided EArly Stopping (SEAS) technique. Our comprehensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates that BPE can boost the performance of\nBatchPrompt with a striking margin on a range of popular NLP tasks, including\nquestion answering (Boolq), textual entailment (RTE), and duplicate questions\nidentification (QQP).

TE treats input texts as premises (P),\noptions as hypotheses (H), then handles the selection problem by modeling (P,\nH) pairwise. Two limitations: first, the pairwise modeling is unaware of other\noptions, which is less intuitive since humans often determine the best options\nby comparing competing candidates; second, the inference process of pairwise TE\nis time-consuming, especially when the option space is large.

We introduce a novel multimodal 2D-3D\nregistration technique to register optical video sequences with ground truth\nrendered views of a known 3D model. The different modalities are registered by\ntransforming optical images to depth maps with a Generative Adversarial Network\nand aligning edge features with an evolutionary optimizer. This registration\nmethod achieves an average translation error of 0.321 millimeters and an\naverage rotation error of 0.159 degrees in simulation experiments where\nerror-free ground truth is available. The method also leverages video\ninformation, improving registration accuracy by 55.6% for translation and 60.4%\nfor rotation compared to single frame registration. 22 short video sequences\nwere registered to generate 10,015 total frames with paired ground truth depth,\nsurface normals, optical flow, occlusion, six degree-of-freedom pose, coverage\nmaps, and 3D models. The dataset also includes screening videos acquired by a\ngastroenterologist with paired ground truth pose and 3D surface models.

To explore such semantic and spatial relationships of densely referred\nobjects for more accurate localization, we propose a novel Stacked Transformer\nbased framework for 3D DOG, named 3DOGSFormer.

Most solutions focus on shallow water\nscenarios, where the scene is uniformly illuminated by the sunlight. However,\nthe vast majority of uncharted underwater terrain is located beyond 200 meters\ndepth where natural light is scarce and artificial illumination is needed. In\nsuch cases, light sources co-moving with the camera, dynamically change the\nscene appearance, which make shallow water restoration methods inadequate. In\nparticular for multi-light source systems (composed of dozens of LEDs\nnowadays), calibrating each light is time-consuming, error-prone and tedious,\nand we observe that only the integrated illumination within the viewing volume\nof the camera is critical, rather than the individual light sources. The key\nidea of this paper is therefore to exploit the appearance changes of objects or\nthe seafloor, when traversing the viewing frustum of the camera. Through new\nconstraints assuming Lambertian surfaces, corresponding image pixels constrain\nthe light field in front of the camera, and for each voxel a signal factor and\na backscatter value are stored in a volumetric grid that can be used for very\nefficient image restoration of camera-light platforms, which facilitates\nconsistently texturing large 3D models and maps that would otherwise be\ndominated by lighting and medium artifacts. To validate the effectiveness of\nour approach, we conducted extensive experiments on simulated and real-world\ndatasets. The results of these experiments demonstrate the robustness of our\napproach in restoring the true albedo of objects, while mitigating the\ninfluence of lighting and medium effects.

Notably, in autonomous driving scenarios, the target object typically\nmaintains spatial adjacency across consecutive frames, predominantly moving\nhorizontally. This spatial continuity offers valuable prior knowledge for\ntarget localization. However, existing trackers, which often employ point-wise\nrepresentations, struggle to efficiently utilize this knowledge owing to the\nirregular format of such representations. Consequently, they require elaborate\ndesigns and solving multiple subtasks to establish spatial correspondence. In\nthis paper, we introduce BEVTrack, a simple yet strong baseline framework for\n3D SOT.

In this paper, we propose a new Semi-Supervised\nVQA-NLE via Self-Critical Learning (S3C), which evaluates the candidate\nexplanations by answering rewards to improve the logical consistency between\nanswers and rationales. With a semi-supervised learning framework, the S3C can\nbenefit from a tremendous amount of samples without human-annotated\nexplanations. A large number of automatic measures and human evaluations all\nshow the effectiveness of our method.

A notable example is\nusing a CNN to detect the presence of clouds in hyperspectral data captured on\nEarth observation (EO) missions, whereby only clear sky data is downlinked to\nconserve bandwidth. However, prior to deployment, new missions that employ new\nsensors will not have enough representative datasets to train a CNN model,\nwhile a model trained solely on data from previous missions will underperform\nwhen deployed to process the data on the new missions.

Dense detectors typically follow a\ntwo-stage pipeline by first constructing a dense BEV feature and then\nperforming object detection in BEV space, which suffers from complex view\ntransformations and high computation cost. On the other side, sparse detectors\nfollow a query-based paradigm without explicit dense BEV feature construction,\nbut achieve worse performance than the dense counterparts. In this paper, we\nfind that the key to mitigate this performance gap is the adaptability of the\ndetector in both BEV and image space. To achieve this goal, we propose\nSparseBEV, a fully sparse 3D object detector that outperforms the dense\ncounterparts. SparseBEV contains three key designs, which are (1)\nscale-adaptive self attention to aggregate features with adaptive receptive\nfield in BEV space, (2) adaptive spatio-temporal sampling to generate sampling\nlocations under the guidance of queries, and (3) adaptive mixing to decode the\nsampled features with dynamic weights from the queries.

In this work, we propose a paradigm for\nlow-light image enhancement that explores the potential of customized learnable\npriors to improve the transparency of the deep unfolding paradigm. Motivated by\nthe powerful feature representation capability of Masked Autoencoder (MAE), we\ncustomize MAE-based illumination and noise priors and redevelop them from two\nperspectives: 1) \\textbf{structure flow}: we train the MAE from a normal-light\nimage to its illumination properties and then embed it into the proximal\noperator design of the unfolding architecture; and m2) \\textbf{optimization\nflow}: we train MAE from a normal-light image to its gradient representation\nand then employ it as a regularization term to constrain noise in the model\noutput. These designs improve the interpretability and representation\ncapability of the model.Extensive experiments on multiple low-light image\nenhancement datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed paradigm over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In conventional\nvideo coding standards, the hierarchical B-frame coding, which utilizes a\nbidirectional prediction structure for higher compression, had been\nwell-studied and exploited. In NVC, however, limited research has investigated\nthe hierarchical B scheme. In this paper, we propose an NVC model exploiting\nhierarchical B-frame coding with temporal layer-adaptive optimization. We first\nextend an existing unidirectional NVC model to a bidirectional model, which\nachieves -21.13% BD-rate gain over the unidirectional baseline model. However,\nthis model faces challenges when applied to sequences with complex or large\nmotions, leading to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce\ntemporal layer-adaptive optimization, incorporating methods such as temporal\nlayer-adaptive quality scaling (TAQS) and temporal layer-adaptive latent\nscaling (TALS). The final model with the proposed methods achieves an\nimpressive BD-rate gain of -39.86% against the baseline. It also resolves the\nchallenges in sequences with large or complex motions with up to -49.13% more\nBD-rate gains than the simple bidirectional extension. This improvement is\nattributed to the allocation of more bits to lower temporal layers, thereby\nenhancing overall reconstruction quality with smaller bits. Since our method\nhas little dependency on a specific NVC model architecture, it can serve as a\ngeneral tool for extending unidirectional NVC models to the ones with\nhierarchical B-frame coding.\n","authors":["Yeongwoong Kim","Suyong Bahk","Seungeon Kim","Won Hee Lee","Dokwan Oh","Hui Yong Kim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15791v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01950v1","updated":"2023-09-05T04:56:18Z","published":"2023-09-05T04:56:18Z","title":"RADIO: Reference-Agnostic Dubbing Video Synthesis","summary":"  One of the most challenging problems in audio-driven talking head generation\nis achieving high-fidelity detail while ensuring precise synchronization.

In this work, we explore constructing a\nwin-win representation on both content and boundary by contributing a new\nlearning model, i.e., Rectangling Rectification Network (RecRecNet).

The distant token problem represents that input tokens are in\nheterogeneous spaces, leading Transformer to fail in capturing correlation\nbetween input tokens. Previous Transformer-based methods suffer from the\nproblem especially when poses of two hands are very different as they project\nfeatures from a backbone to separate left and right hand-dedicated features.

This is\nespecially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few items (e.g.,\npopular ones) are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists and\nusers' interactions with those items will amplify bias towards those items over\ntime resulting in a feedback loop. This issue has been extensively studied in\nthe literature in static recommendation environment where a single round of\nrecommendation result is processed to improve the exposure fairness. However,\nless work has been done on addressing exposure bias in a dynamic recommendation\nsetting where the system is operating over time, the recommendation model and\nthe input data are dynamically updated with ongoing user feedback on\nrecommended items at each round. In this paper, we study exposure bias in a\ndynamic recommendation setting. Our goal is to show that existing bias\nmitigation methods that are designed to operate in a static recommendation\nsetting are unable to satisfy fairness of exposure for items in long run. In\nparticular, we empirically study one of these methods and show that repeatedly\napplying this method fails to fairly distribute exposure among items in long\nrun.

Recently, Relaxed\nRanking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in\nthe recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the\nmethod still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the\nprediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully\nefficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which\nprovides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper\npresents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the\nranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more\nefficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the\nteacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be\ndistilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored\nto \"correcting\" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This\nprocess is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side\nas well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback.

This can become problematic in several\nscenarios, e.g. if measurements are provided at irregularly-sampled time steps\nor physical system properties have to be conserved. Thus, we aim for a GP model\nof the true continuous-time dynamics.

In order to make direct inference tractable, we propose to leverage\nmultistep and Taylor integrators. We demonstrate how to derive flexible\ninference schemes for these types of integrators.

Some existing methods adopt the 1-vs-K\nscheme to construct one positive and K negative samples for each graph, but it\nis difficult to set K. For those methods that do not use negative samples, it\nis often necessary to add additional strategies to avoid model collapse, which\ncould only alleviate the problem to some extent. All these drawbacks will\nundoubtedly have an adverse impact on the generalizability and efficiency of\nthe model. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a novel graph\nself-contrast framework GraphSC, which only uses one positive and one negative\nsample, and chooses triplet loss as the objective. Specifically, self-contrast\nhas two implications. First, GraphSC generates both positive and negative views\nof a graph sample from the graph itself via graph augmentation functions of\nvarious intensities, and use them for self-contrast. Second, GraphSC uses\nHilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to factorize the representations\ninto multiple factors and proposes a masked self-contrast mechanism to better\nseparate positive and negative samples.

However, theoretical\nformulations of their capability are scarce, despite their empirical\neffectiveness in state-of-the-art recommender models. Recently, research has\nexplored the expressiveness of GNNs in general, demonstrating that message\npassing GNNs are at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, and that\nGNNs combined with random node initialization are universal. Nevertheless, the\nconcept of \"expressiveness\" for GNNs remains vaguely defined. Most existing\nworks adopt the graph isomorphism test as the metric of expressiveness, but\nthis graph-level task may not effectively assess a model's ability in\nrecommendation, where the objective is to distinguish nodes of different\ncloseness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of\nthe expressiveness of GNNs in recommendation, considering three levels of\nexpressiveness metrics: graph isomorphism (graph-level), node automorphism\n(node-level), and topological closeness (link-level). We propose the\ntopological closeness metric to evaluate GNNs' ability to capture the\nstructural distance between nodes, which aligns closely with the objective of\nrecommendation. To validate the effectiveness of this new metric in evaluating\nrecommendation performance, we introduce a learning-less GNN algorithm that is\noptimal on the new metric and can be optimal on the node-level metric with\nsuitable modification.

Still, the algorithm\nrequires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e.,\nnudges, to estimate unbiased gradients efficiently. Both requirements are\nchallenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight\nasymmetry affects its applicability is unknown because, in practice, it may be\nmasked by biases introduced through the finite nudge. To address this question,\nwe study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and\nanalytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable\nnon-symmetric networks, we show that the finite nudge does not pose a problem,\nas exact derivatives can still be estimated via a Cauchy integral. In contrast,\nweight asymmetry introduces bias resulting in low task performance due to poor\nalignment of EP's neuronal error vectors compared to BP.

Medication\nrecommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient\nhistory with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and\nmore accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent\nlong-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between\nhead and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative\nrelevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data\nlong-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of\nmedication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method\nusing deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we\ndesign a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized\nentity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based\non this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication\nprecision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations.\nFinally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate\nmedication combinations for the current health condition.

And, the\nadversarial examples have transferability, which means that an adversarial\nexample for a DNN model can fool another model with a non-trivial probability.\nThis gave birth to the transfer-based attack where the adversarial examples\ngenerated by a surrogate model are used to conduct black-box attacks. There are\nsome work on generating the adversarial examples from a given surrogate model\nwith better transferability. However, training a special surrogate model to\ngenerate adversarial examples with better transferability is relatively\nunder-explored. This paper proposes a method for training a surrogate model\nwith dark knowledge to boost the transferability of the adversarial examples\ngenerated by the surrogate model. This trained surrogate model is named dark\nsurrogate model (DSM). The proposed method for training a DSM consists of two\nkey components: a teacher model extracting dark knowledge, and the mixing\naugmentation skill enhancing dark knowledge of training data. We conducted\nextensive experiments to show that the proposed method can substantially\nimprove the adversarial transferability of surrogate models across different\narchitectures of surrogate models and optimizers for generating adversarial\nexamples, and it can be applied to other scenarios of transfer-based attack\nthat contain dark knowledge, like face verification.

Most causal inference models based on the POF (CIMs-POF) are\ndesigned for eliminating confounding bias and default to an underlying\nassumption of Confounding Covariates. This assumption posits that the\ncovariates consist solely of confounders. However, the assumption of\nConfounding Covariates is challenging to maintain in practice, particularly\nwhen dealing with high-dimensional covariates. While certain methods have been\nproposed to differentiate the distinct components of covariates prior to\nconducting causal inference, the consequences of treating non-confounding\ncovariates as confounders remain unclear. This ambiguity poses a potential risk\nwhen conducting causal inference in practical scenarios. In this paper, we\npresent a unified graphical framework for the CIMs-POF, which greatly enhances\nthe comprehension of these models' underlying principles. Using this graphical\nframework, we quantitatively analyze the extent to which the inference\nperformance of CIMs-POF is influenced when incorporating various types of\nnon-confounding covariates, such as instrumental variables, mediators,\ncolliders, and adjustment variables. The key findings are: in the task of\neliminating confounding bias, the optimal scenario is for the covariates to\nexclusively encompass confounders; in the subsequent task of inferring\ncounterfactual outcomes, the adjustment variables contribute to more accurate\ninferences.

While previous approaches focused on learning only the final design\ninstead of sequential design tasks, we propose to encode the design knowledge\nfrom a collection of expert or high-performing design sequences and extract\nuseful representations using transformer-based models. Later we propose to\nutilize the learned representations for crucial downstream applications such as\ndesign preference evaluation and procedural design generation. We develop the\npreference model by estimating the density of the learned representations\nwhereas we train an autoregressive transformer model for sequential design\ngeneration. We demonstrate our ideas by leveraging a novel dataset of thousands\nof sequential volumetric designs. Our preference model can compare two\narbitrarily given design sequences and is almost 90% accurate in evaluation\nagainst random design sequences. Our autoregressive model is also capable of\nautocompleting a volumetric design sequence from a partial design sequence.\n","authors":["Md Ferdous Alam","Yi Wang","Linh Tran","Chin-Yi Cheng","Jieliang Luo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02583v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06651v2","updated":"2023-09-05T21:13:37Z","published":"2022-08-13T13:41:44Z","title":"Revisiting Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Networks for Graph\n  Classification","summary":"  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in the task of\ngraph classification and its diverse downstream real-world applications.\nDespite the huge success in learning graph representations, current GNN models\nhave demonstrated their vulnerability to potentially existent adversarial\nexamples on graph-structured data.

T cell receptors (TCRs) are essential proteins for the adaptive\nimmune system, and their specific recognition of antigens plays a crucial role\nin the immune response against diseases, including cancer. The diversity and\nspecificity of TCRs make them ideal for targeting cancer cells, and recent\nadvancements in sequencing technologies have enabled the comprehensive\nprofiling of TCR repertoires. This has led to the discovery of TCRs with potent\nanti-cancer activity and the development of TCR-based immunotherapies. In this\nstudy, we investigate the use of sparse coding for the multi-class\nclassification of TCR protein sequences with cancer categories as target\nlabels. Sparse coding is a popular technique in machine learning that enables\nthe representation of data with a set of informative features and can capture\ncomplex relationships between amino acids and identify subtle patterns in the\nsequence that might be missed by low-dimensional methods. We first compute the\nk-mers from the TCR sequences and then apply sparse coding to capture the\nessential features of the data. To improve the predictive performance of the\nfinal embeddings, we integrate domain knowledge regarding different types of\ncancer properties. We then train different machine learning (linear and\nnon-linear) classifiers on the embeddings of TCR sequences for the purpose of\nsupervised analysis. Our proposed embedding method on a benchmark dataset of\nTCR sequences significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of predictive\nperformance, achieving an accuracy of 99.8\\%.

We\nfind that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with\nthe relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more\nchallenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more\npowerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and\npreprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in\ncomputer vision.\n","authors":["Neel Jain","Avi Schwarzschild","Yuxin Wen","Gowthami Somepalli","John Kirchenbauer","Ping-yeh Chiang","Micah Goldblum","Aniruddha Saha","Jonas Geiping","Tom Goldstein"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.00614v2.pdf","comment":"12 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01717v1","updated":"2023-09-04T16:54:49Z","published":"2023-09-04T16:54:49Z","title":"Interdisciplinary Fairness in Imbalanced Research Proposal Topic\n  Inference: A Hierarchical Transformer-based Method with Selective\n  Interpolation","summary":"  The objective of topic inference in research proposals aims to obtain the\nmost suitable disciplinary division from the discipline system defined by a\nfunding agency. The agency will subsequently find appropriate peer review\nexperts from their database based on this division. Automated topic inference\ncan reduce human errors caused by manual topic filling, bridge the knowledge\ngap between funding agencies and project applicants, and improve system\nefficiency. Existing methods focus on modeling this as a hierarchical\nmulti-label classification problem, using generative models to iteratively\ninfer the most appropriate topic information. However, these methods overlook\nthe gap in scale between interdisciplinary research proposals and\nnon-interdisciplinary ones, leading to an unjust phenomenon where the automated\ninference system categorizes interdisciplinary proposals as\nnon-interdisciplinary, causing unfairness during the expert assignment. How can\nwe address this data imbalance issue under a complex discipline system and\nhence resolve this unfairness? In this paper, we implement a topic label\ninference system based on a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture.\nFurthermore, we utilize interpolation techniques to create a series of\npseudo-interdisciplinary proposals from non-interdisciplinary ones during\ntraining based on non-parametric indicators such as cross-topic probabilities\nand topic occurrence probabilities.

They are typically subject to a set of structural constraints\nrestricting their content. However, manual taxonomy construction can be\ntime-consuming, incomplete, and costly to maintain. Recent studies of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have demonstrated that appropriate user inputs (called\nprompting) can effectively guide LLMs, such as GPT-3, in diverse NLP tasks\nwithout explicit (re-)training. However, existing approaches for automated\ntaxonomy construction typically involve fine-tuning a language model by\nadjusting model parameters. In this paper, we present a general framework for\ntaxonomy construction that takes into account structural constraints. We\nsubsequently conduct a systematic comparison between the prompting and\nfine-tuning approaches performed on a hypernym taxonomy and a novel computer\nscience taxonomy dataset. Our result reveals the following: (1) Even without\nexplicit training on the dataset, the prompting approach outperforms\nfine-tuning-based approaches. Moreover, the performance gap between prompting\nand fine-tuning widens when the training dataset is small. However, (2)\ntaxonomies generated by the fine-tuning approach can be easily post-processed\nto satisfy all the constraints, whereas handling violations of the taxonomies\nproduced by the prompting approach can be challenging.

Furthermore, a malicious user might\nattempt to deliberately evade the detectors based on detection results, but\nthis has not been assumed in previous studies. In this paper, we propose\nOUTFOX, a framework that improves the robustness of LLM-generated-text\ndetectors by allowing both the detector and the attacker to consider each\nother's output. In this framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction\nlabels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays\nthat are harder to detect, while the detector uses the adversarially generated\nessays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a\nstrong attacker. Experiments in the domain of student essays show that the\nproposed detector improves the detection performance on the attacker-generated\ntexts by up to +41.3 points in F1-score. Furthermore, the proposed detector\nshows a state-of-the-art detection performance: up to 96.9 points in F1-score,\nbeating existing detectors on non-attacked texts.

One differentiating factor between language processing in LLMs and\nhumans is that language input is often grounded in several perceptual\nmodalities, whereas most LLMs process solely text-based information. Multimodal\ngrounding allows humans to integrate - e.g. visual context with linguistic\ninformation and thereby place constraints on the space of upcoming words,\nreducing cognitive load and improving comprehension.

Eye-tracking was used to estimate what visual features\nparticipants attended to, and CLIP's visual attention weights were recorded. We\nfind that alignment of predictability scores was driven by multimodality of\nCLIP (no alignment for a unimodal state-of-the-art LLM) and by the attention\nmechanism (no alignment when attention weights were perturbated or when the\nsame input was fed to a multimodal model without attention).

However, following the\nRECIST criteria, radiologists routinely only delineate each lesion on the axial\nslice showing the largest transverse area, and delineate a small number of\nlesions in 3D for research purposes. As a result, we have plenty of unlabeled\n3D volumes and labeled 2D images, and scarce labeled 3D volumes, which makes\ntraining a deep-learning 3D segmentation model a challenging task. In this\nwork, we propose a novel model, denoted a multi-dimension unified Swin\ntransformer (MDU-ST), for 3D lesion segmentation. The MDU-ST consists of a\nShifted-window transformer (Swin-transformer) encoder and a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) decoder, allowing it to adapt to 2D and 3D inputs and\nlearn the corresponding semantic information in the same encoder. Based on this\nmodel, we introduce a three-stage framework: 1) leveraging large amount of\nunlabeled 3D lesion volumes through self-supervised pretext tasks to learn the\nunderlying pattern of lesion anatomy in the Swin-transformer encoder; 2)\nfine-tune the Swin-transformer encoder to perform 2D lesion segmentation with\n2D RECIST slices to learn slice-level segmentation information; 3) further\nfine-tune the Swin-transformer encoder to perform 3D lesion segmentation with\nlabeled 3D volumes.

In the present work, we\ncombine image and point cloud modalities by first learning self-supervised\nimage features and then using these features to train a 3D model. By\nincorporating image data, which is often included in many 3D datasets, our\npre-training method only requires a single scan of a scene and can be applied\nto cases where localization information is unavailable. We demonstrate that our\npre-training approach, despite using single scans, achieves comparable\nperformance to other multi-scan, point cloud-only methods.\n","authors":["Andrej Janda","Brandon Wagstaff","Edwin G.

In this\npaper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to\ncomprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we construct\na comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world\nimages and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27\nsubtasks. This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and\ncomprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integrating\ndetailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input\ncontent into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advanced\nLLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without\nrequiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful\nLVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging\ntheir textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences.

However, the current methods redirect the detection target of the object\ndecoder, and the box target is not explicitly separated from the query\nembeddings, which leads to long and hard training. Furthermore, matching the\npredicted HOI instances with the ground-truth is more challenging than object\ndetection, simply adapting training strategies from the object detection makes\nthe training more difficult. To clear the ambiguity between human and object\ndetection and share the prediction burden, we propose a novel one-stage\nframework (SOV), which consists of a subject decoder, an object decoder, and a\nverb decoder.

The target audience\nfocuses on, but is not limited to inexperienced researchers and students,\nespecially from the field of computer science. The tool is based on a fuzzy\nmatching of author surnames, titles, and DOIs. Experiments were performed on a\nsample of 1,000 arXiv-preprints from the research field of computer science and\nwithout any publication information. With 77.94 %, computer science is highly\naffected by missing publication information in arXiv. The results show that the\nPreprintResolver was able to resolve 603 out of 1,000 (60.3 %) arXiv-preprints\nfrom the research field of computer science and without any publication\ninformation. All four literature databases contributed to the final result. In\na manual validation, a random sample of 100 resolved preprints was checked. For\nall preprints, at least one result is plausible. For nine preprints, more than\none result was identified, three of which are partially invalid. In conclusion\nthe PreprintResolver is suitable for individual, manually reviewed requests,\nbut less suitable for bulk requests.

Despite the efforts made in previous\nstudies to address NOCDR, several limitations still exist. Specifically, 1)\nwhile some approaches substitute overlapping users/items with overlapping\nbehaviors, they cannot handle NOCDR scenarios where such auxiliary information\nis unavailable; 2) often, cross-domain preference mapping is modeled by\nlearning deterministic explicit representation matchings between sampled users\nin two domains. However, this can be biased due to individual preferences and\nthus fails to incorporate preference continuity and universality of the general\npopulation. In light of this, we assume that despite the scattered nature of\nuser behaviors, there exists a consistent latent preference distribution shared\namong common people. Modeling such distributions further allows us to capture\nthe continuity in user behaviors within each domain and discover preference\ninvariance across domains. To this end, we propose a Distributional\ndomain-invariant Preference Matching method for non-overlapping Cross-Domain\nRecommendation (DPMCDR). For each domain, we hierarchically approximate a\nposterior of domain-level preference distribution with empirical evidence\nderived from user-item interactions. Next, we aim to build distributional\nimplicit matchings between the domain-level preferences of two domains. This\nprocess involves mapping them to a shared latent space and seeking a consensus\non domain-invariant preference by minimizing the distance between their\ndistributional representations therein. In this way, we can identify the\nalignment of two non-overlapping domains if they exhibit similar patterns of\ndomain-invariant preference.\n","authors":["Jing Du","Zesheng Ye","Bin Guo","Zhiwen Yu","Lina Yao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01343v1.pdf","comment":"9 pages, 5 figures, full research paper accepted by ICDM 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01335v1","updated":"2023-09-04T03:34:54Z","published":"2023-09-04T03:34:54Z","title":"In-processing User Constrained Dominant Sets for User-Oriented Fairness\n  in Recommender Systems","summary":"  Recommender systems are typically biased toward a small group of users,\nleading to severe unfairness in recommendation performance, i.e., User-Oriented\nFairness (UOF) issue.

This skew hurts recommender quality especially for the item slices\nwithout much user feedback. While there have been many research advances made\nin academia, deploying these methods in production is very difficult and very\nfew improvements have been made in industry. One challenge is that these\nmethods often hurt overall performance; additionally, they could be complex and\nexpensive to train and serve. In this work, we aim to improve tail item\nrecommendations while maintaining the overall performance with less training\nand serving cost. We first find that the predictions of user preferences are\nbiased under long-tail distributions. The bias comes from the differences\nbetween training and serving data in two perspectives: 1) the item\ndistributions, and 2) user's preference given an item. Most existing methods\nmainly attempt to reduce the bias from the item distribution perspective,\nignoring the discrepancy from user preference given an item. This leads to a\nsevere forgetting issue and results in sub-optimal performance.\n  To address the problem, we design a novel Cross Decoupling Network (CDN) (i)\ndecouples the learning process of memorization and generalization on the item\nside through a mixture-of-expert architecture; (ii) decouples the user samples\nfrom different distributions through a regularized bilateral branch network.\nFinally, a new adapter is introduced to aggregate the decoupled vectors, and\nsoftly shift the training attention to tail items. Extensive experimental\nresults show that CDN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nbenchmark datasets. We also demonstrate its effectiveness by a case study of\nCDN in a large-scale recommendation system at Google.\n","authors":["Yin Zhang","Ruoxi Wang","Tiansheng Yao","Xinyang Yi","Lichan Hong","James Caverlee","Ed H.

Although effective deepfake detectors have\nbeen proposed, they are substantially vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To\nevaluate the detector's robustness, recent studies have explored various\nattacks. However, all existing attacks are limited to 2D image perturbations,\nwhich are hard to translate into real-world facial changes. In this paper, we\npropose adversarial head turn (AdvHeat), the first attempt at 3D adversarial\nface views against deepfake detectors, based on face view synthesis from a\nsingle-view fake image. Extensive experiments validate the vulnerability of\nvarious detectors to AdvHeat in realistic, black-box scenarios. For example,\nAdvHeat based on a simple random search yields a high attack success rate of\n96.8% with 360 searching steps. When additional query access is allowed, we can\nfurther reduce the step budget to 50. Additional analyses demonstrate that\nAdvHeat is better than conventional attacks on both the cross-detector\ntransferability and robustness to defenses. The adversarial images generated by\nAdvHeat are also shown to have natural looks.

Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias\nevaluation categorizes datasets by their structure as counterfactual inputs or\nprompts, and identifies the targeted harms and social groups; we also release a\nconsolidation of publicly-available datasets for improved access. Our third\ntaxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation classifies methods by their\nintervention during pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and\npost-processing, with granular subcategories that elucidate research trends.\nFinally, we identify open problems and challenges for future work.

Nevertheless, the process of searching and ranking from a\nlarge item corpus usually requires high latency, which limits the widespread\ndeployment of GNNs in industry-scale applications. To address this issue, many\nmethods compress user/item representations into the binary embedding space to\nreduce space requirements and accelerate inference. Also, they use the\nStraight-through Estimator (STE) to prevent vanishing gradients during\nback-propagation. However, the STE often causes the gradient mismatch problem,\nleading to sub-optimal results.\n  In this work, we present the Hessian-aware Quantized GNN (HQ-GNN) as an\neffective solution for discrete representations of users/items that enable fast\nretrieval. HQ-GNN is composed of two components: a GNN encoder for learning\ncontinuous node embeddings and a quantized module for compressing\nfull-precision embeddings into low-bit ones. Consequently, HQ-GNN benefits from\nboth lower memory requirements and faster inference speeds compared to vanilla\nGNNs. To address the gradient mismatch problem in STE, we further consider the\nquantized errors and its second-order derivatives for better stability.

In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver\n(KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge\nbases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design\na simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision\nsequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot\nmanner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and\ntherefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct\nexperiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and\nfound that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large\nmargin.\n","authors":["Chao Feng","Xinyu Zhang","Zichu Fei"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03118v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03103v1","updated":"2023-09-06T15:41:38Z","published":"2023-09-06T15:41:38Z","title":"ContrastWSD: Enhancing Metaphor Detection with Word Sense Disambiguation\n  Following the Metaphor Identification Procedure","summary":"  This paper presents ContrastWSD, a RoBERTa-based metaphor detection model\nthat integrates the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) and Word Sense\nDisambiguation (WSD) to extract and contrast the contextual meaning with the\nbasic meaning of a word to determine whether it is used metaphorically in a\nsentence.

Yet, human behaviour is a key element\nin predicting the human impact of an earthquake, therefore, it is important to\ninclude it in quantitative risk assessment studies. In this study, an\ninterdisciplinary approach simulating pedestrians' evacuation during\nearthquakes at the city scale is developed using an agent-based model. The\nmodel integrates the seismic hazard, the physical vulnerability as well as\nindividuals' behaviours and mobility. The simulator is applied to the case of\nBeirut, Lebanon. Lebanon is at the heart of the Levant fault system that has\ngenerated several Mw>7 earthquakes, the latest being in 1759. It is one of the\ncountries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is\ndue to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of\nmandatory seismic regulation until 2012, the high level of urbanization, and\nthe lack of adequate spatial planning and risk prevention policies. Beirut as\nthe main residential, economic and institutional hub of Lebanon is densely\npopulated. To accommodate the growing need for urban development, constructions\nhave almost taken over all of the green areas of the city; squares and gardens\nare disappearing to give place to skyscrapers. However, open spaces are safe\nplaces to shelter, away from debris, and therefore play an essential role in\nearthquake evacuation. Despite the massive urbanization, there are a few open\nspaces but locked gates and other types of anthropogenic barriers often limit\ntheir access. To simulate this complex context, pedestrians' evacuation\nsimulations are run in a highly realistic spatial environment implemented in\nGAMA [1]. Previous data concerning soil and buildings in Beirut [2, 3] are\ncomplemented by new geographic data extracted from high-resolution Pleiades\nsatellite images. The seismic loading is defined as a peak ground acceleration\nof 0.3g, as stated in Lebanese seismic regulations. Building damages are\nestimated using an artificial neural network trained to predict the mean damage\n[4] based on the seismic loading as well as the soil and building vibrational\nproperties [5]. Moreover, the quantity and the footprint of the generated\ndebris around each building are also estimated and included in the model. We\nsimulate how topography, buildings, debris, and access to open spaces, affect\nindividuals' mobility. Two city configurations are implemented: 1. Open spaces\nare accessible without any barriers; 2. Access to some open spaces is blocked.\nThe first simulation results show that while 52% of the population is able to\narrive to an open space within 5 minutes after an earthquake, this number is\nreduced to 39% when one of the open spaces is locked. These results show that\nthe presence of accessible open spaces in a city and their proximity to the\nresidential buildings is a crucial factor for ensuring people's safety when an\nearthquake occurs.\n","authors":["Rouba Iskandar","Kamel Allaw","Julie Dugdale","Elise Beck","Jocelyne Adjizian-GÃ©rard","CÃ©cile Cornou","Jacques Harb","Pascal Lacroix","Nada Badaro-Saliba","StÃ©phane Cartier","Rita Zaarour"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02812v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02784v1","updated":"2023-09-06T06:51:15Z","published":"2023-09-06T06:51:15Z","title":"Norm Tweaking: High-performance Low-bit Quantization of Large Language\n  Models","summary":"  As the size of large language models (LLMs) continues to grow, model\ncompression without sacrificing accuracy has become a crucial challenge for\ndeployment.

In this paper, we conduct the\nfirst systematic study to explore a decoding strategy specialized in code\ngeneration. With an analysis of loss distributions of code tokens, we find that\ncode tokens can be divided into two categories: challenging tokens that are\ndifficult to predict and confident tokens that can be easily inferred. Among\nthem, the challenging tokens mainly appear at the beginning of a code block.\nInspired by the above findings, we propose a simple yet effective method:\nAdaptive Temperature (AdapT) sampling, which dynamically adjusts the\ntemperature coefficient when decoding different tokens. We apply a larger\ntemperature when sampling for challenging tokens, allowing LLMs to explore\ndiverse choices.

The\nkey idea is to use a complex and high-order degradation model to mimic\nreal-world degradations. Although they have achieved impressive results in\nvarious scenarios, they are faced with the obstacle of evaluation. Currently,\nthese methods are only assessed by their average performance on a small set of\ndegradation cases randomly selected from a large space, which fails to provide\na comprehensive understanding of their overall performance and often yields\nbiased results. To overcome the limitation in evaluation, we propose SEAL, a\nframework for systematic evaluation of real-SR. In particular, we cluster the\nextensive degradation space to create a set of representative degradation\ncases, which serves as a comprehensive test set. Next, we propose a\ncoarse-to-fine evaluation protocol to measure the distributed and relative\nperformance of real-SR methods on the test set. The protocol incorporates two\nnew metrics: acceptance rate (AR) and relative performance ratio (RPR), derived\nfrom an acceptance line and an excellence line. Under SEAL, we benchmark\nexisting real-SR methods, obtain new observations and insights into their\nperformance, and develop a new strong baseline.

Present\ntracking methods suffer from issues of low accuracy or poor robustness. In\norder to address these concerns, this paper proposes a novel tracking approach,\nnamed FishMOT (Fish Multiple Object Tracking). This method combines object\ndetection techniques with the IoU matching algorithm, thereby achieving\nefficient, precise, and robust fish detection and tracking. Diverging from\nother approaches, this method eliminates the need for multiple feature\nextractions and identity assignments for each individual, instead directly\nutilizing the output results of the detector for tracking, thereby\nsignificantly reducing computational time and storage space. Furthermore, this\nmethod imposes minimal requirements on factors such as video quality and\nvariations in individual appearance. As long as the detector can accurately\nlocate and identify fish, effective tracking can be achieved. This approach\nenhances robustness and generalizability. Moreover, the algorithm employed in\nthis method addresses the issue of missed detections without relying on complex\nfeature matching or graph optimization algorithms.

Interestingly, we observe that the attention mechanism of ViTs\ntends to rely on few important tokens, a phenomenon we call token overfocusing.\nMore critically, these tokens are not robust to corruptions, often leading to\nhighly diverging attention patterns. In this paper, we intend to alleviate this\noverfocusing issue and make attention more stable through two general\ntechniques: First, our Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module encourages the\nlocal neighborhood of each token to take part in the attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, TAP learns average pooling schemes for each token such that the\ninformation of potentially important tokens in the neighborhood can adaptively\nbe taken into account. Second, we force the output tokens to aggregate\ninformation from a diverse set of input tokens rather than focusing on just a\nfew by using our Attention Diversification Loss (ADL). We achieve this by\npenalizing high cosine similarity between the attention vectors of different\ntokens.

We balance the training process with a mix of negative and\npositive samples from the outset, named as Joint learning with Negative samples\n(JN). Negative samples refer to scenarios where the object from the template is\nnot present in the search region, which helps to prevent the model from simply\nmemorizing the target, and instead encourages it to use the template for object\nlocation. To handle the negative samples effectively, we adopt a\ndistribution-based head, which modeling the bounding box as distribution of\ndistances to express uncertainty about the target's location in the presence of\nnegative samples, offering an efficient way to manage the mixed sample\ntraining.

However,\nexcessive computational overhead still plagues the application of VLPs. In this\npaper, we aim at parameter and computation efficient transfer learning (PCETL)\nfor VLP models. In particular, PCETL not only needs to limit the number of\ntrainable parameters in VLP models, but also to reduce the computational\nredundancy during inference, thus enabling a more efficient transfer. To\napproach this target, we propose a novel dynamic architecture skipping (DAS)\napproach towards effective PCETL. Instead of directly optimizing the intrinsic\narchitectures of VLP models, DAS first observes the significances of their\nmodules to downstream tasks via a reinforcement learning (RL) based process,\nand then skips the redundant ones with lightweight networks, i.e., adapters,\naccording to the obtained rewards. In this case, the VLP model can well\nmaintain the scale of trainable parameters while speeding up its inference on\ndownstream tasks. To validate DAS, we apply it to two representative VLP\nmodels, namely ViLT and METER, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of\nVL tasks. The experimental results not only show the great advantages of DAS in\nreducing computational complexity, e.g. -11.97% FLOPs of METER on VQA2.0, but\nalso confirm its competitiveness against existing PETL methods in terms of\nparameter scale and performance.

Recently, LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved\nremarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However, significant\nerrors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities, i.e.,\ndepth edges, which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications\nthat are sensitive to such inaccuracies, e.g., novel view synthesis and\naugmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is\ntypically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes, encouraging the MDE model\nto produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. To the best of our\nknowledge this paper is the first attempt to address the depth edges issue for\nLIDAR-supervised scenes. In this work we propose to learn to detect the\nlocation of depth edges from densely-supervised synthetic data, and use it to\ngenerate supervision for the depth edges in the MDE training. %Despite the\n'domain gap' between synthetic and real data, we show that depth edges that are\nestimated directly are significantly more accurate than the ones that emerge\nindirectly from the MDE training.

Although recent advances in object-centric\nlearning have made remarkable progress on complex synthesis datasets, there is\na huge challenge for application to complex real-world scenes. One of the\nessential reasons is the scarcity of real-world datasets specifically tailored\nto object-centric learning. To address this problem, we propose a versatile\nreal-world dataset of tabletop scenes for object-centric learning called\nOCTScenes, which is meticulously designed to serve as a benchmark for\ncomparing, evaluating, and analyzing object-centric learning methods. OCTScenes\ncontains 5000 tabletop scenes with a total of 15 objects. Each scene is\ncaptured in 60 frames covering a 360-degree perspective. Consequently,\nOCTScenes is a versatile benchmark dataset that can simultaneously satisfy the\nevaluation of object-centric learning methods based on single-image, video, and\nmulti-view. Extensive experiments of representative object-centric learning\nmethods are conducted on OCTScenes.

Generally, each\nrecommendation framework implements its multimodal extraction procedures with\nspecific strategies and tools. This is limiting for two reasons: (i) different\nextraction strategies do not ease the interdependence among multimodal\nrecommendation frameworks; thus, they cannot be efficiently and fairly\ncompared; (ii) given the large plethora of pre-trained deep learning models\nmade available by different open source tools, model designers do not have\naccess to shared interfaces to extract features. Motivated by the outlined\naspects, we propose \\framework, a unified framework for the extraction of\nmultimodal features in recommendation. By integrating three widely-adopted deep\nlearning libraries as backends, namely, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Transformers,\nwe provide a shared interface to extract and process features where each\nbackend's specific methods are abstracted to the end user. Noteworthy, the\nextraction pipeline is easily configurable with a YAML-based file where the\nuser can specify, for each modality, the list of models (and their specific\nbackends/parameters) to perform the extraction.

Recently, Adaptive Feature\nSelection (AdaFS) has shown remarkable performance by adaptively selecting\nfeatures for each data instance, considering that the importance of a given\nfeature field can vary significantly across data. However, this method still\nhas limitations in that its selection process could be easily biased to major\nfeatures that frequently occur. To address these problems, we propose\nMulti-view Feature Selection (MvFS), which selects informative features for\neach instance more effectively. Most importantly, MvFS employs a multi-view\nnetwork consisting of multiple sub-networks, each of which learns to measure\nthe feature importance of a part of data with different feature patterns. By\ndoing so, MvFS mitigates the bias problem towards dominant patterns and\npromotes a more balanced feature selection process. Moreover, MvFS adopts an\neffective importance score modeling strategy which is applied independently to\neach field without incurring dependency among features.

In safety-critical domains\nsuch as autonomous vehicles, offline deep reinforcement learning (offline DRL)\nis frequently used to train models on pre-collected datasets, as opposed to\ntraining these models by interacting with the real-world environment as the\nonline DRL. To support the development of these models, many institutions make\ndatasets publicly available with opensource licenses, but these datasets are at\nrisk of potential misuse or infringement. Injecting watermarks to the dataset\nmay protect the intellectual property of the data, but it cannot handle\ndatasets that have already been published and is infeasible to be altered\nafterward. Other existing solutions, such as dataset inference and membership\ninference, do not work well in the offline DRL scenario due to the diverse\nmodel behavior characteristics and offline setting constraints. In this paper,\nwe advocate a new paradigm by leveraging the fact that cumulative rewards can\nact as a unique identifier that distinguishes DRL models trained on a specific\ndataset.

A key component in simulating spectra is\nthe pressure-temperature (PT) profile, which describes the thermal structure of\nthe atmosphere. Current AR pipelines commonly use ad hoc fitting functions here\nthat limit the retrieved PT profiles to simple approximations, but still use a\nrelatively large number of parameters. In this work, we introduce a\nconceptually new, data-driven parameterization scheme for physically consistent\nPT profiles that does not require explicit assumptions about the functional\nform of the PT profiles and uses fewer parameters than existing methods. Our\napproach consists of a latent variable model (based on a neural network) that\nlearns a distribution over functions (PT profiles). Each profile is represented\nby a low-dimensional vector that can be used to condition a decoder network\nthat maps $P$ to $T$. When training and evaluating our method on two publicly\navailable datasets of self-consistent PT profiles, we find that our method\nachieves, on average, better fit quality than existing baseline methods,\ndespite using fewer parameters. In an AR based on existing literature, our\nmodel (using two parameters) produces a tighter, more accurate posterior for\nthe PT profile than the five-parameter polynomial baseline, while also speeding\nup the retrieval by more than a factor of three. By providing parametric access\nto physically consistent PT profiles, and by reducing the number of parameters\nrequired to describe a PT profile (thereby reducing computational cost or\nfreeing resources for additional parameters of interest), our method can help\nimprove AR and thus our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and their\nhabitability.\n","authors":["Timothy D.

Further,\nthey suffer from deteriorated behavior over time due to accumulating errors.\nOften, simulators building on first principles are available being physically\nmeaningful by design. However, modeling simplifications typically cause\ninaccuracies in these models. Consequently, hybrid modeling is an emerging\ntrend that aims to combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we propose a\nnew approach to hybrid modeling, where we inform the latent states of a learned\nmodel via a black-box simulator. This allows to control the predictions via the\nsimulator preventing them from accumulating errors.

Most message-passing models act as graph convolutions, where\nfeatures are mixed by a shared, linear transformation before being propagated\nover the edges. On node-classification tasks, graph convolutions have been\nshown to suffer from two limitations: poor performance on heterophilic graphs,\nand over-smoothing. It is common belief that both phenomena occur because such\nmodels behave as low-pass filters, meaning that the Dirichlet energy of the\nfeatures decreases along the layers incurring a smoothing effect that\nultimately makes features no longer distinguishable. In this work, we\nrigorously prove that simple graph-convolutional models can actually enhance\nhigh frequencies and even lead to an asymptotic behaviour we refer to as\nover-sharpening, opposite to over-smoothing. We do so by showing that linear\ngraph convolutions with symmetric weights minimize a multi-particle energy that\ngeneralizes the Dirichlet energy; in this setting, the weight matrices induce\nedge-wise attraction (repulsion) through their positive (negative) eigenvalues,\nthereby controlling whether the features are being smoothed or sharpened.

However, there are more non-neighbour nodes in the whole graph, which\nprovide diverse and useful information for the representation update. Two\nnon-adjacent nodes usually have different representations, which can be seen as\nnegative samples. Besides the node representations, the structural information\nof the graph is also crucial for learning.

However, this method still\nhas limitations in that its selection process could be easily biased to major\nfeatures that frequently occur. To address these problems, we propose\nMulti-view Feature Selection (MvFS), which selects informative features for\neach instance more effectively. Most importantly, MvFS employs a multi-view\nnetwork consisting of multiple sub-networks, each of which learns to measure\nthe feature importance of a part of data with different feature patterns. By\ndoing so, MvFS mitigates the bias problem towards dominant patterns and\npromotes a more balanced feature selection process. Moreover, MvFS adopts an\neffective importance score modeling strategy which is applied independently to\neach field without incurring dependency among features.

Our framework tackles full 3D\nreconstruction for varying subjects (patients) where each reconstruction is\nbased only on a single panoramic image. We create an intermediate\nrepresentation called simulated PX (SimPX) from 3D Cone-beam computed\ntomography (CBCT) data based on the Beer-Lambert law of X-ray rendering and\nrotational principles of PX imaging. SimPX aims at not only truthfully\nsimulating PX, but also facilitates the reverting process back to 3D data. We\npropose a novel neural model based on ray tracing which exploits both global\nand local input features to convert SimPX to 3D output. At inference, a real PX\nimage is translated to a SimPX-style image with semantic regularization, and\nthe translated image is processed by generation module to produce high-quality\noutputs.

This greatly reduces the\noverall trust in model predictions, especially in safety-critical applications.\nEarly work in improving model calibration employs post-processing techniques\nwhich rely on limited parameters and require a hold-out set. Some recent\ntrain-time calibration methods, which involve all model parameters, can\noutperform the postprocessing methods. To this end, we propose a new train-time\ncalibration method, which features a simple, plug-and-play auxiliary loss known\nas multi-class alignment of predictive mean confidence and predictive certainty\n(MACC). It is based on the observation that a model miscalibration is directly\nrelated to its predictive certainty, so a higher gap between the mean\nconfidence and certainty amounts to a poor calibration both for in-distribution\nand out-of-distribution predictions. Armed with this insight, our proposed loss\nexplicitly encourages a confident (or underconfident) model to also provide a\nlow (or high) spread in the presoftmax distribution. Extensive experiments on\nten challenging datasets, covering in-domain, out-domain, non-visual\nrecognition and medical image classification scenarios, show that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art calibration performance for both in-domain and\nout-domain predictions.

While a big wave of machine\nlearning (ML) has propagated in accelerating computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nstudies, recent research has revealed that it is unrealistic to completely\nsuppress the error increase as the gap between the training and prediction\ntimes increases in single training approach. In this study, we propose a\nresidual-based physics-informed transfer learning (RePIT) strategy to\naccelerate unsteady heat and mass transfer simulations using ML-CFD cross\ncomputation. Our hypothesis is that long-term CFD simulations become feasible\nif continuous ML-CFD cross computation is periodically carried out to not only\nreduce increased residuals but also update network parameters with the latest\nCFD time series data (transfer learning approach). The cross point of ML-CFD is\ndetermined using a method similar to residual monitoring methods of first\nprinciple solvers (physics-informed manner). The feasibility of the proposed\nstrategy was evaluated based on natural convection simulation and compared to\nthe single training approach. In the single training approach, a residual scale\nchange occurred around 100 timesteps leading to predicted time series\nexhibiting non-physical pattern as well as a large difference from the ground\ntruth. Conversely, it was confirmed that the RePIT strategy maintained the\ncontinuity residual within the set range and showed good agreement with the\nground truth for all variables and locations. The simulation was accelerated by\n1.9 times, including the parameter-updating time.

For simple tasks, researchers typically handcraft\nthe reward function, e.g., using a linear combination of several reward\nfactors. However, such reward engineering is subject to approximation bias,\nincurs large tuning cost, and often cannot provide the granularity required for\ncomplex tasks. To avoid these difficulties, researchers have turned to\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward\nfunction from human preferences between pairs of trajectory sequences. By\nleveraging preference-based reward modeling, RLHF learns complex rewards that\nare well aligned with human preferences, allowing RL to tackle increasingly\ndifficult problems. Unfortunately, the applicability of RLHF is limited due to\nthe high cost and difficulty of obtaining human preference data. In light of\nthis cost, we investigate learning reward functions for complex tasks with less\nhuman effort; simply by ranking the importance of the reward factors. More\nspecifically, we propose a new RL framework -- HERON, which compares\ntrajectories using a hierarchical decision tree induced by the given ranking.\nThese comparisons are used to train a preference-based reward model, which is\nthen used for policy learning. We find that our framework can not only train\nhigh performing agents on a variety of difficult tasks, but also provide\nadditional benefits such as improved sample efficiency and robustness.

Generally, each\nrecommendation framework implements its multimodal extraction procedures with\nspecific strategies and tools. This is limiting for two reasons: (i) different\nextraction strategies do not ease the interdependence among multimodal\nrecommendation frameworks; thus, they cannot be efficiently and fairly\ncompared; (ii) given the large plethora of pre-trained deep learning models\nmade available by different open source tools, model designers do not have\naccess to shared interfaces to extract features. Motivated by the outlined\naspects, we propose \\framework, a unified framework for the extraction of\nmultimodal features in recommendation. By integrating three widely-adopted deep\nlearning libraries as backends, namely, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Transformers,\nwe provide a shared interface to extract and process features where each\nbackend's specific methods are abstracted to the end user. Noteworthy, the\nextraction pipeline is easily configurable with a YAML-based file where the\nuser can specify, for each modality, the list of models (and their specific\nbackends/parameters) to perform the extraction.

The key\nchallenge for this task is obtaining an editing model that generates new\ntalking-head video clips which simultaneously have accurate lip synchronization\nand motion smoothness. Previous approaches, including 3DMM-based (3D Morphable\nModel) methods and NeRF-based (Neural Radiance Field) methods, are sub-optimal\nin that they either require minutes of source videos and days of training time\nor lack the disentangled control of verbal (e.g., lip motion) and non-verbal\n(e.g., head pose and expression) representations for video clip insertion. In\nthis work, we fully utilize the video context to design a novel framework for\ntalking-head video editing, which achieves efficiency, disentangled motion\ncontrol, and sequential smoothness. Specifically, we decompose this framework\nto motion prediction and motion-conditioned rendering: (1) We first design an\nanimation prediction module that efficiently obtains smooth and lip-sync motion\nsequences conditioned on the driven speech. This module adopts a\nnon-autoregressive network to obtain context prior and improve the prediction\nefficiency, and it learns a speech-animation mapping prior with better\ngeneralization to novel speech from a multi-identity video dataset.
